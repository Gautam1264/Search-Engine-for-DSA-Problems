b'Given two integers tomatoSlices and cheeseSlices. The ingredients of different burgers are as follows:\n\nJumbo Burger: 4 tomato slices and 1 cheese slice.\nSmall Burger: 2 Tomato slices and 1 cheese slice.\n\nReturn [total_jumbo, total_small] so that the number of remaining tomatoSlices equal to 0 and the number of remaining cheeseSlices equal to 0. If it is not possible to make the remaining tomatoSlices and cheeseSlices equal to 0 return [].\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: tomatoSlices = 16, cheeseSlices = 7\nOutput: [1,6]\nExplantion: To make one jumbo burger and 6 small burgers we need 4*1 + 2*6 = 16 tomato and 1 + 6 = 7 cheese.\nThere will be no remaining ingredients.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: tomatoSlices = 17, cheeseSlices = 4\nOutput: []\nExplantion: There will be no way to use all ingredients to make small and jumbo burgers.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: tomatoSlices = 4, cheeseSlices = 17\nOutput: []\nExplantion: Making 1 jumbo burger there will be 16 cheese remaining and making 2 small burgers there will be 15 cheese remaining.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n0 <= tomatoSlices, cheeseSlices <= 107\n\n'

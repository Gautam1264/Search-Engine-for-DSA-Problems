b"You are given two integers n and k and two integer arrays speed and efficiency both of length n. There are n engineers numbered from 1 to n. speed[i] and efficiency[i] represent the speed and efficiency of the ith engineer respectively.\nChoose at most k different engineers out of the n engineers to form a team with the maximum performance.\nThe performance of a team is the sum of their engineers' speeds multiplied by the minimum efficiency among their engineers.\nReturn the maximum performance of this team. Since the answer can be a huge number, return it modulo 109 + 7.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 2\nOutput: 60\nExplanation: \nWe have the maximum performance of the team by selecting engineer 2 (with speed=10 and efficiency=4) and engineer 5 (with speed=5 and efficiency=7). That is, performance = (10 + 5) * min(4, 7) = 60.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 3\nOutput: 68\nExplanation:\nThis is the same example as the first but k = 3. We can select engineer 1, engineer 2 and engineer 5 to get the maximum performance of the team. That is, performance = (2 + 10 + 5) * min(5, 4, 7) = 68.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 4\nOutput: 72\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= k <= n <= 105\nspeed.length == n\nefficiency.length == n\n1 <= speed[i] <= 105\n1 <= efficiency[i] <= 108\n\n"

b'A wonderful string is a string where at most one letter appears an odd number of times.\n\nFor example, "ccjjc" and "abab" are wonderful, but "ab" is not.\n\nGiven a string word that consists of the first ten lowercase English letters (\'a\' through \'j\'), return the number of wonderful non-empty substrings in word. If the same substring appears multiple times in word, then count each occurrence separately.\nA substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: word = "aba"\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: The four wonderful substrings are underlined below:\n- "aba" -> "a"\n- "aba" -> "b"\n- "aba" -> "a"\n- "aba" -> "aba"\n\nExample 2:\nInput: word = "aabb"\nOutput: 9\nExplanation: The nine wonderful substrings are underlined below:\n- "aabb" -> "a"\n- "aabb" -> "aa"\n- "aabb" -> "aab"\n- "aabb" -> "aabb"\n- "aabb" -> "a"\n- "aabb" -> "abb"\n- "aabb" -> "b"\n- "aabb" -> "bb"\n- "aabb" -> "b"\n\nExample 3:\nInput: word = "he"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The two wonderful substrings are underlined below:\n- "he" -> "h"\n- "he" -> "e"\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= word.length <= 105\nword consists of lowercase English letters from \'a\'\xc2\xa0to \'j\'.\n'

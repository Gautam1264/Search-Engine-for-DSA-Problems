b'Given two non-negative integers, num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2 as a string.\nYou must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers (such as BigInteger). You must also not convert the inputs to integers directly.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: num1 = "11", num2 = "123"\nOutput: "134"\n\nExample 2:\nInput: num1 = "456", num2 = "77"\nOutput: "533"\n\nExample 3:\nInput: num1 = "0", num2 = "0"\nOutput: "0"\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 104\nnum1 and num2 consist of only digits.\nnum1 and num2 don\'t have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.\n\n'

b'Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2\nOutput: [1,2,3,5]\n\nExample 2:\nInput: head = [1], n = 1\nOutput: []\n\nExample 3:\nInput: head = [1,2], n = 1\nOutput: [1]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the list is sz.\n1 <= sz <= 30\n0 <= Node.val <= 100\n1 <= n <= sz\n\n\xc2\xa0\nFollow up: Could you do this in one pass?\n'

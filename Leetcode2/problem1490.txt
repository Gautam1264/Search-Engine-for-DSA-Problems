b'You are given a very large integer n, represented as a string,\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b and an integer digit x. The digits in n and the digit x are in the inclusive range [1, 9], and n may represent a negative number.\nYou want to maximize n\'s numerical value by inserting x anywhere in the decimal representation of n\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b. You cannot insert x to the left of the negative sign.\n\nFor example, if n = 73 and x = 6, it would be best to insert it between 7 and 3, making n = 763.\nIf n = -55 and x = 2, it would be best to insert it before the first 5, making n = -255.\n\nReturn a string representing the maximum value of n\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b after the insertion.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = "99", x = 9\nOutput: "999"\nExplanation: The result is the same regardless of where you insert 9.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = "-13", x = 2\nOutput: "-123"\nExplanation: You can make n one of {-213, -123, -132}, and the largest of those three is -123.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n.length <= 105\n1 <= x <= 9\nThe digits in n\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b are in the range [1, 9].\nn is a valid representation of an integer.\nIn the case of a negative n,\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b it will begin with \'-\'.\n\n'

b'You are given an array tasks where tasks[i] = [actuali, minimumi]:\n\nactuali is the actual amount of energy you spend to finish the ith task.\nminimumi is the minimum amount of energy you require to begin the ith task.\n\nFor example, if the task is [10, 12] and your current energy is 11, you cannot start this task. However, if your current energy is 13, you can complete this task, and your energy will be 3 after finishing it.\nYou can finish the tasks in any order you like.\nReturn the minimum initial amount of energy you will need to finish all the tasks.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: tasks = [[1,2],[2,4],[4,8]]\nOutput: 8\nExplanation:\nStarting with 8 energy, we finish the tasks in the following order:\n    - 3rd task. Now energy = 8 - 4 = 4.\n    - 2nd task. Now energy = 4 - 2 = 2.\n    - 1st task. Now energy = 2 - 1 = 1.\nNotice that even though we have leftover energy, starting with 7 energy does not work because we cannot do the 3rd task.\nExample 2:\nInput: tasks = [[1,3],[2,4],[10,11],[10,12],[8,9]]\nOutput: 32\nExplanation:\nStarting with 32 energy, we finish the tasks in the following order:\n    - 1st task. Now energy = 32 - 1 = 31.\n    - 2nd task. Now energy = 31 - 2 = 29.\n    - 3rd task. Now energy = 29 - 10 = 19.\n    - 4th task. Now energy = 19 - 10 = 9.\n    - 5th task. Now energy = 9 - 8 = 1.\nExample 3:\nInput: tasks = [[1,7],[2,8],[3,9],[4,10],[5,11],[6,12]]\nOutput: 27\nExplanation:\nStarting with 27 energy, we finish the tasks in the following order:\n    - 5th task. Now energy = 27 - 5 = 22.\n    - 2nd task. Now energy = 22 - 2 = 20.\n    - 3rd task. Now energy = 20 - 3 = 17.\n    - 1st task. Now energy = 17 - 1 = 16.\n    - 4th task. Now energy = 16 - 4 = 12.\n    - 6th task. Now energy = 12 - 6 = 6.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= tasks.length <= 105\n1 <= actual\xe2\x80\x8bi\xc2\xa0<= minimumi\xc2\xa0<= 104\n\n'

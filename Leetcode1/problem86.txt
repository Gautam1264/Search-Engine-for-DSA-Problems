b'Given the head of a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.\nYou should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: head = [1,4,3,2,5,2], x = 3\nOutput: [1,2,2,4,3,5]\n\nExample 2:\nInput: head = [2,1], x = 2\nOutput: [1,2]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 200].\n-100 <= Node.val <= 100\n-200 <= x <= 200\n\n'

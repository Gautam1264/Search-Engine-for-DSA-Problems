b'Given an array of integers arr of even length n and an integer k.\nWe want to divide the array into exactly n / 2 pairs such that the sum of each pair is divisible by k.\nReturn true If you can find a way to do that or false otherwise.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: arr = [1,2,3,4,5,10,6,7,8,9], k = 5\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Pairs are (1,9),(2,8),(3,7),(4,6) and (5,10).\n\nExample 2:\nInput: arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6], k = 7\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Pairs are (1,6),(2,5) and(3,4).\n\nExample 3:\nInput: arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6], k = 10\nOutput: false\nExplanation: You can try all possible pairs to see that there is no way to divide arr into 3 pairs each with sum divisible by 10.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\narr.length == n\n1 <= n <= 105\nn is even.\n-109 <= arr[i] <= 109\n1 <= k <= 105\n\n'

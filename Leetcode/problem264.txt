b"A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by\xc2\xa0exactly\xc2\xa0one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.\nGiven a tree of n nodes\xc2\xa0labelled from 0 to n - 1, and an array of\xc2\xa0n - 1\xc2\xa0edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes\xc2\xa0ai and\xc2\xa0bi in the tree,\xc2\xa0you can choose any node of the tree as the root. When you select a node x as the root, the result tree has height h. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height (i.e. min(h))\xc2\xa0 are called minimum height trees (MHTs).\nReturn a list of all MHTs' root labels.\xc2\xa0You can return the answer in any order.\nThe height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 4, edges = [[1,0],[1,2],[1,3]]\nOutput: [1]\nExplanation: As shown, the height of the tree is 1 when the root is the node with label 1 which is the only MHT.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 6, edges = [[3,0],[3,1],[3,2],[3,4],[5,4]]\nOutput: [3,4]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 2 * 104\nedges.length == n - 1\n0 <= ai, bi < n\nai != bi\nAll the pairs (ai, bi) are distinct.\nThe given input is guaranteed to be a tree and there will be no repeated edges.\n\n"

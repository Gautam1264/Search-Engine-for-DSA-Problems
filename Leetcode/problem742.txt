b'Let\'s say a positive integer is a super-palindrome if it is a palindrome, and it is also the square of a palindrome.\nGiven two positive integers left and right represented as strings, return the number of super-palindromes integers in the inclusive range [left, right].\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: left = "4", right = "1000"\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: 4, 9, 121, and 484 are superpalindromes.\nNote that 676 is not a superpalindrome: 26 * 26 = 676, but 26 is not a palindrome.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: left = "1", right = "2"\nOutput: 1\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= left.length, right.length <= 18\nleft and right consist of only digits.\nleft and right cannot have leading zeros.\nleft and right represent integers in the range [1, 1018 - 1].\nleft is less than or equal to right.\n\n'

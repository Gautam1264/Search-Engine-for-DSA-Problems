b'Given two numbers arr1 and arr2 in base -2, return the result of adding them together.\nEach number is given in array format:\xc2\xa0 as an array of 0s and 1s, from most significant bit to least significant bit.\xc2\xa0 For example, arr = [1,1,0,1] represents the number (-2)^3\xc2\xa0+ (-2)^2 + (-2)^0 = -3.\xc2\xa0 A number arr in array, format is also guaranteed to have no leading zeros: either\xc2\xa0arr == [0] or arr[0] == 1.\nReturn the result of adding arr1 and arr2 in the same format: as an array of 0s and 1s with no leading zeros.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: arr1 = [1,1,1,1,1], arr2 = [1,0,1]\nOutput: [1,0,0,0,0]\nExplanation: arr1 represents 11, arr2 represents 5, the output represents 16.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: arr1 = [0], arr2 = [0]\nOutput: [0]\n\nExample 3:\nInput: arr1 = [0], arr2 = [1]\nOutput: [1]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= arr1.length,\xc2\xa0arr2.length <= 1000\narr1[i]\xc2\xa0and arr2[i] are\xc2\xa00 or 1\narr1 and arr2 have no leading zeros\n\n'

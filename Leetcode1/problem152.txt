b'Given an integer array nums, find a contiguous non-empty subarray within the array that has the largest product, and return the product.\nThe test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.\nA subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [2,3,-2,4]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [-2,0,-1]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104\n-10 <= nums[i] <= 10\nThe product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.\n\n'

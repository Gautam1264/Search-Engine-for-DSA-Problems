b'Under the grammar given below, strings can represent a set of lowercase words. Let\xc2\xa0R(expr)\xc2\xa0denote the set of words the expression represents.\nThe grammar can best be understood through simple examples:\n\nSingle letters represent a singleton set containing that word.\n\t\nR("a") = {"a"}\nR("w") = {"w"}\n\n\nWhen we take a comma-delimited list of two or more expressions, we take the union of possibilities.\n\t\nR("{a,b,c}") = {"a","b","c"}\nR("{{a,b},{b,c}}") = {"a","b","c"} (notice the final set only contains each word at most once)\n\n\nWhen we concatenate two expressions, we take the set of possible concatenations between two words where the first word comes from the first expression and the second word comes from the second expression.\n\t\nR("{a,b}{c,d}") = {"ac","ad","bc","bd"}\nR("a{b,c}{d,e}f{g,h}") = {"abdfg", "abdfh", "abefg", "abefh", "acdfg", "acdfh", "acefg", "acefh"}\n\n\n\nFormally, the three rules for our grammar:\n\nFor every lowercase letter x, we have R(x) = {x}.\nFor expressions e1, e2, ... , ek with k >= 2, we have R({e1, e2, ...}) = R(e1) \xe2\x88\xaa R(e2) \xe2\x88\xaa ...\nFor expressions e1 and e2, we have R(e1 + e2) = {a + b for (a, b) in R(e1) \xc3\x97 R(e2)}, where + denotes concatenation, and \xc3\x97 denotes the cartesian product.\n\nGiven an expression representing a set of words under the given grammar, return the sorted list of words that the expression represents.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: expression = "{a,b}{c,{d,e}}"\nOutput: ["ac","ad","ae","bc","bd","be"]\n\nExample 2:\nInput: expression = "{{a,z},a{b,c},{ab,z}}"\nOutput: ["a","ab","ac","z"]\nExplanation: Each distinct word is written only once in the final answer.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= expression.length <= 60\nexpression[i] consists of \'{\', \'}\', \',\'or lowercase English letters.\nThe given\xc2\xa0expression\xc2\xa0represents a set of words based on the grammar given in the description.\n\n'

b'You are given an array of integers distance.\nYou start at point (0,0) on an X-Y plane and you move distance[0] meters to the north, then distance[1] meters to the west, distance[2] meters to the south, distance[3] meters to the east, and so on. In other words, after each move, your direction changes counter-clockwise.\nReturn true if your path crosses itself, and false if it does not.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: distance = [2,1,1,2]\nOutput: true\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: distance = [1,2,3,4]\nOutput: false\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: distance = [1,1,1,1]\nOutput: true\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <=\xc2\xa0distance.length <= 105\n1 <=\xc2\xa0distance[i] <= 105\n\n'

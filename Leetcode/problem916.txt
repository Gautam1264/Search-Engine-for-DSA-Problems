b'Suppose you are given the following code:\nclass FooBar {\n  public void foo() {\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n      print("foo");\n    }\n  }\n\n  public void bar() {\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n      print("bar");\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThe same instance of FooBar will be passed to two different threads:\n\nthread A will call foo(), while\nthread B will call bar().\n\nModify the given program to output "foobar" n times.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 1\nOutput: "foobar"\nExplanation: There are two threads being fired asynchronously. One of them calls foo(), while the other calls bar().\n"foobar" is being output 1 time.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 2\nOutput: "foobarfoobar"\nExplanation: "foobar" is being output 2 times.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 1000\n\n'

b'Given a set of distinct positive integers nums, return the largest subset answer such that every pair (answer[i], answer[j]) of elements in this subset satisfies:\n\nanswer[i] % answer[j] == 0, or\nanswer[j] % answer[i] == 0\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, return any of them.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [1,2,3]\nOutput: [1,2]\nExplanation: [1,3] is also accepted.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [1,2,4,8]\nOutput: [1,2,4,8]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 1000\n1 <= nums[i] <= 2 * 109\nAll the integers in nums are unique.\n\n'

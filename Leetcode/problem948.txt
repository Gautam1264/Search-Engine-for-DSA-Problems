b'Let the function f(s) be the frequency of the lexicographically smallest character in a non-empty string s. For example, if s = "dcce" then f(s) = 2 because the lexicographically smallest character is \'c\', which has a frequency of 2.\nYou are given an array of strings words and another array of query strings queries. For each query queries[i], count the number of words in words such that f(queries[i]) < f(W) for each W in words.\nReturn an integer array answer, where each answer[i] is the answer to the ith query.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: queries = ["cbd"], words = ["zaaaz"]\nOutput: [1]\nExplanation: On the first query we have f("cbd") = 1, f("zaaaz") = 3 so f("cbd") < f("zaaaz").\n\nExample 2:\nInput: queries = ["bbb","cc"], words = ["a","aa","aaa","aaaa"]\nOutput: [1,2]\nExplanation: On the first query only f("bbb") < f("aaaa"). On the second query both f("aaa") and f("aaaa") are both > f("cc").\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= queries.length <= 2000\n1 <= words.length <= 2000\n1 <= queries[i].length, words[i].length <= 10\nqueries[i][j], words[i][j] consist of lowercase English letters.\n\n'

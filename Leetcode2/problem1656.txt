b'You are given the root of a binary tree with n nodes. Each node is uniquely assigned a value from 1 to n. You are also given an integer startValue representing the value of the start node s, and a different integer destValue representing the value of the destination node t.\nFind the shortest path starting from node s and ending at node t. Generate step-by-step directions of such path as a string consisting of only the uppercase letters \'L\', \'R\', and \'U\'. Each letter indicates a specific direction:\n\n\'L\' means to go from a node to its left child node.\n\'R\' means to go from a node to its right child node.\n\'U\' means to go from a node to its parent node.\n\nReturn the step-by-step directions of the shortest path from node s to node t.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [5,1,2,3,null,6,4], startValue = 3, destValue = 6\nOutput: "UURL"\nExplanation: The shortest path is: 3 \xe2\x86\x92 1 \xe2\x86\x92 5 \xe2\x86\x92 2 \xe2\x86\x92 6.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [2,1], startValue = 2, destValue = 1\nOutput: "L"\nExplanation: The shortest path is: 2 \xe2\x86\x92 1.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is n.\n2 <= n <= 105\n1 <= Node.val <= n\nAll the values in the tree are unique.\n1 <= startValue, destValue <= n\nstartValue != destValue\n\n'

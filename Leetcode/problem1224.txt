b'Given an array arr\xc2\xa0of positive integers\xc2\xa0sorted in a strictly increasing order, and an integer k.\nFind the kth\xc2\xa0positive integer that is missing from this array.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5\nOutput: 9\nExplanation: The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...]. The 5th\xc2\xa0missing positive integer is 9.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: arr = [1,2,3,4], k = 2\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The missing positive integers are [5,6,7,...]. The 2nd missing positive integer is 6.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= arr.length <= 1000\n1 <= arr[i] <= 1000\n1 <= k <= 1000\narr[i] < arr[j] for 1 <= i < j <= arr.length\n\n'

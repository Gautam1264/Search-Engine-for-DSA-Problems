b'Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum width of the given tree.\nThe maximum width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels.\nThe width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and rightmost non-null nodes), where the null nodes between the end-nodes that would be present in a complete binary tree extending down to that level are also counted into the length calculation.\nIt is guaranteed that the answer will in the range of a 32-bit signed integer.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [1,3,2,5,3,null,9]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: The maximum width exists in the third level with length 4 (5,3,null,9).\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [1,3,2,5,null,null,9,6,null,7]\nOutput: 7\nExplanation: The maximum width exists in the fourth level with length 7 (6,null,null,null,null,null,7).\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: root = [1,3,2,5]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The maximum width exists in the second level with length 2 (3,2).\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3000].\n-100 <= Node.val <= 100\n\n'

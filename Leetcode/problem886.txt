b'A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in non-decreasing order by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array expected where expected[i] is the expected height of the ith student in line.\nYou are given an integer array heights representing the current order that the students are standing in. Each heights[i] is the height of the ith student in line (0-indexed).\nReturn the number of indices where heights[i] != expected[i].\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: \nheights:  [1,1,4,2,1,3]\nexpected: [1,1,1,2,3,4]\nIndices 2, 4, and 5 do not match.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: heights = [5,1,2,3,4]\nOutput: 5\nExplanation:\nheights:  [5,1,2,3,4]\nexpected: [1,2,3,4,5]\nAll indices do not match.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: heights = [1,2,3,4,5]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation:\nheights:  [1,2,3,4,5]\nexpected: [1,2,3,4,5]\nAll indices match.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= heights.length <= 100\n1 <= heights[i] <= 100\n\n'

b'Given two strings s and goal, return true if you can swap two letters in s so the result is equal to goal, otherwise, return false.\nSwapping letters is defined as taking two indices i and j (0-indexed) such that i != j and swapping the characters at s[i] and s[j].\n\nFor example, swapping at indices 0 and 2 in "abcd" results in "cbad".\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "ab", goal = "ba"\nOutput: true\nExplanation: You can swap s[0] = \'a\' and s[1] = \'b\' to get "ba", which is equal to goal.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "ab", goal = "ab"\nOutput: false\nExplanation: The only letters you can swap are s[0] = \'a\' and s[1] = \'b\', which results in "ba" != goal.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s = "aa", goal = "aa"\nOutput: true\nExplanation: You can swap s[0] = \'a\' and s[1] = \'a\' to get "aa", which is equal to goal.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 2 * 104\ns and goal consist of lowercase letters.\n\n'

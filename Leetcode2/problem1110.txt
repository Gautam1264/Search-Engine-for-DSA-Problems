b"There are n soldiers standing in a line. Each soldier is assigned a unique rating value.\nYou have to form a team of 3 soldiers amongst them under the following rules:\n\nChoose 3 soldiers with index (i, j, k) with rating (rating[i], rating[j], rating[k]).\nA team is valid if: (rating[i] < rating[j] < rating[k]) or (rating[i] > rating[j] > rating[k]) where (0 <= i < j < k < n).\n\nReturn the number of teams you can form given the conditions. (soldiers can be part of multiple teams).\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: rating = [2,5,3,4,1]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: We can form three teams given the conditions. (2,3,4), (5,4,1), (5,3,1). \n\nExample 2:\nInput: rating = [2,1,3]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: We can't form any team given the conditions.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: rating = [1,2,3,4]\nOutput: 4\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nn == rating.length\n3 <= n <= 1000\n1 <= rating[i] <= 105\nAll the integers in rating are unique.\n\n"

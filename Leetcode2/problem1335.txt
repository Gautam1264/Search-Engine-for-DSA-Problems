b'You are given a string allowed consisting of distinct characters and an array of strings words. A string is consistent if all characters in the string appear in the string allowed.\nReturn the number of consistent strings in the array words.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: allowed = "ab", words = ["ad","bd","aaab","baa","badab"]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Strings "aaab" and "baa" are consistent since they only contain characters \'a\' and \'b\'.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: allowed = "abc", words = ["a","b","c","ab","ac","bc","abc"]\nOutput: 7\nExplanation: All strings are consistent.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: allowed = "cad", words = ["cc","acd","b","ba","bac","bad","ac","d"]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: Strings "cc", "acd", "ac", and "d" are consistent.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= words.length <= 104\n1 <= allowed.length <= 26\n1 <= words[i].length <= 10\nThe characters in allowed are distinct.\nwords[i] and allowed contain only lowercase English letters.\n\n'

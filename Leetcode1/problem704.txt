b'Given a positive integer n, find and return the longest distance between any two adjacent 1\'s in the binary representation of n. If there are no two adjacent 1\'s, return 0.\nTwo 1\'s are adjacent if there are only 0\'s separating them (possibly no 0\'s). The distance between two 1\'s is the absolute difference between their bit positions. For example, the two 1\'s in "1001" have a distance of 3.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 22\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: 22 in binary is "10110".\nThe first adjacent pair of 1\'s is "10110" with a distance of 2.\nThe second adjacent pair of 1\'s is "10110" with a distance of 1.\nThe answer is the largest of these two distances, which is 2.\nNote that "10110" is not a valid pair since there is a 1 separating the two 1\'s underlined.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 8\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: 8 in binary is "1000".\nThere are not any adjacent pairs of 1\'s in the binary representation of 8, so we return 0.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: n = 5\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: 5 in binary is "101".\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 109\n\n'

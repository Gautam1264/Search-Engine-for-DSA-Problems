b'Given an array of strings strs, return the length of the longest uncommon subsequence between them. If the longest uncommon subsequence does not exist, return -1.\nAn uncommon subsequence between an array of strings is a string that is a subsequence of one string but not the others.\nA subsequence of a string s is a string that can be obtained after deleting any number of characters from s.\n\nFor example, "abc" is a subsequence of "aebdc" because you can delete the underlined characters in "aebdc" to get "abc". Other subsequences of "aebdc" include "aebdc", "aeb", and "" (empty string).\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: strs = ["aba","cdc","eae"]\nOutput: 3\nExample 2:\nInput: strs = ["aaa","aaa","aa"]\nOutput: -1\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= strs.length <= 50\n1 <= strs[i].length <= 10\nstrs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.\n\n'

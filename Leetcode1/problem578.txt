b'You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a double booking.\nA double booking happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to both events.).\nThe event can be represented as a pair of integers start and end that represents a booking on the half-open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.\nImplement the MyCalendar class:\n\nMyCalendar() Initializes the calendar object.\nboolean book(int start, int end) Returns true if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a double booking. Otherwise, return false and do not add the event to the calendar.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput\n["MyCalendar", "book", "book", "book"]\n[[], [10, 20], [15, 25], [20, 30]]\nOutput\n[null, true, false, true]\n\nExplanation\nMyCalendar myCalendar = new MyCalendar();\nmyCalendar.book(10, 20); // return True\nmyCalendar.book(15, 25); // return False, It can not be booked because time 15 is already booked by another event.\nmyCalendar.book(20, 30); // return True, The event can be booked, as the first event takes every time less than 20, but not including 20.\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n0 <= start < end <= 109\nAt most 1000 calls will be made to book.\n\n'

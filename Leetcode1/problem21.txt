b'You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.\nMerge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.\nReturn the head of the merged linked list.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]\nOutput: [1,1,2,3,4,4]\n\nExample 2:\nInput: list1 = [], list2 = []\nOutput: []\n\nExample 3:\nInput: list1 = [], list2 = [0]\nOutput: [0]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].\n-100 <= Node.val <= 100\nBoth list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n'

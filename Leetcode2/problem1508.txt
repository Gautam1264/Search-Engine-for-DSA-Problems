b'You are given a string num, representing a large integer. Return the largest-valued odd integer (as a string) that is a non-empty substring of num, or an empty string "" if no odd integer exists.\nA substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: num = "52"\nOutput: "5"\nExplanation: The only non-empty substrings are "5", "2", and "52". "5" is the only odd number.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: num = "4206"\nOutput: ""\nExplanation: There are no odd numbers in "4206".\n\nExample 3:\nInput: num = "35427"\nOutput: "35427"\nExplanation: "35427" is already an odd number.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= num.length <= 105\nnum only consists of digits and does not contain any leading zeros.\n\n'

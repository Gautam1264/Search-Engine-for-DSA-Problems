b'We build a table of n rows (1-indexed). We start by writing 0 in the 1st row. Now in every subsequent row, we look at the previous row and replace each occurrence of 0 with 01, and each occurrence of 1 with 10.\n\nFor example, for n = 3, the 1st row is 0, the 2nd row is 01, and the 3rd row is 0110.\n\nGiven two integer n and k, return the kth (1-indexed) symbol in the nth row of a table of n rows.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 1, k = 1\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: row 1: 0\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 2, k = 1\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: \nrow 1: 0\nrow 2: 01\n\nExample 3:\nInput: n = 2, k = 2\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: \nrow 1: 0\nrow 2: 01\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 30\n1 <= k <= 2n - 1\n\n'

b'You are given a string s formed by digits and \'#\'. We want to map s to English lowercase characters as follows:\n\nCharacters (\'a\' to \'i\') are represented by (\'1\' to \'9\') respectively.\nCharacters (\'j\' to \'z\') are represented by (\'10#\' to \'26#\') respectively.\n\nReturn the string formed after mapping.\nThe test cases are generated so that a unique mapping will always exist.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "10#11#12"\nOutput: "jkab"\nExplanation: "j" -> "10#" , "k" -> "11#" , "a" -> "1" , "b" -> "2".\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "1326#"\nOutput: "acz"\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 1000\ns consists of digits and the \'#\' letter.\ns will be a valid string such that mapping is always possible.\n\n'

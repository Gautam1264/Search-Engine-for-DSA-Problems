b'Given the head of a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.\nFor this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: head = [-10,-3,0,5,9]\nOutput: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]\nExplanation: One possible answer is [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the shown height balanced BST.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: head = []\nOutput: []\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in head is in the range [0, 2 * 104].\n-105 <= Node.val <= 105\n\n'

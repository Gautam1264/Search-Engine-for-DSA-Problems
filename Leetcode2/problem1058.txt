b'You want to schedule a list of jobs in d days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To work on the ith job, you have to finish all the jobs j where 0 <= j < i).\nYou have to finish at least one task every day. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the d days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done on that day.\nYou are given an integer array jobDifficulty and an integer d. The difficulty of the ith job is jobDifficulty[i].\nReturn the minimum difficulty of a job schedule. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return -1.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2\nOutput: 7\nExplanation: First day you can finish the first 5 jobs, total difficulty = 6.\nSecond day you can finish the last job, total difficulty = 1.\nThe difficulty of the schedule = 6 + 1 = 7 \n\nExample 2:\nInput: jobDifficulty = [9,9,9], d = 4\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: If you finish a job per day you will still have a free day. you cannot find a schedule for the given jobs.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: jobDifficulty = [1,1,1], d = 3\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The schedule is one job per day. total difficulty will be 3.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= jobDifficulty.length <= 300\n0 <= jobDifficulty[i] <= 1000\n1 <= d <= 10\n\n'

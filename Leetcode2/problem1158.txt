b'Given a sentence that consists of some words separated by a single space, and a searchWord, check if searchWord is a prefix of any word in sentence.\nReturn the index of the word in sentence (1-indexed) where searchWord is a prefix of this word. If searchWord is a prefix of more than one word, return the index of the first word (minimum index). If there is no such word return -1.\nA prefix of a string s is any leading contiguous substring of s.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: sentence = "i love eating burger", searchWord = "burg"\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: "burg" is prefix of "burger" which is the 4th word in the sentence.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: sentence = "this problem is an easy problem", searchWord = "pro"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: "pro" is prefix of "problem" which is the 2nd and the 6th word in the sentence, but we return 2 as it\'s the minimal index.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: sentence = "i am tired", searchWord = "you"\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: "you" is not a prefix of any word in the sentence.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= sentence.length <= 100\n1 <= searchWord.length <= 10\nsentence consists of lowercase English letters and spaces.\nsearchWord consists of lowercase English letters.\n\n'

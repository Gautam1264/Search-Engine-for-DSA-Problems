b'Return all non-negative integers of length n such that the absolute difference between every two consecutive digits is k.\nNote that every number in the answer must not have leading zeros. For example, 01 has one leading zero and is invalid.\nYou may return the answer in any order.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 3, k = 7\nOutput: [181,292,707,818,929]\nExplanation: Note that 070 is not a valid number, because it has leading zeroes.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 2, k = 1\nOutput: [10,12,21,23,32,34,43,45,54,56,65,67,76,78,87,89,98]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= n <= 9\n0 <= k <= 9\n\n'

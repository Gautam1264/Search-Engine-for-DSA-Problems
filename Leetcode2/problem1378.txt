b'You are given two strings a and b that consist of lowercase letters. In one operation, you can change any character in a or b to any lowercase letter.\nYour goal is to satisfy one of the following three conditions:\n\nEvery letter in a is strictly less than every letter in b in the alphabet.\nEvery letter in b is strictly less than every letter in a in the alphabet.\nBoth a and b consist of only one distinct letter.\n\nReturn the minimum number of operations needed to achieve your goal.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: a = "aba", b = "caa"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Consider the best way to make each condition true:\n1) Change b to "ccc" in 2 operations, then every letter in a is less than every letter in b.\n2) Change a to "bbb" and b to "aaa" in 3 operations, then every letter in b is less than every letter in a.\n3) Change a to "aaa" and b to "aaa" in 2 operations, then a and b consist of one distinct letter.\nThe best way was done in 2 operations (either condition 1 or condition 3).\n\nExample 2:\nInput: a = "dabadd", b = "cda"\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The best way is to make condition 1 true by changing b to "eee".\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= a.length, b.length <= 105\na and b consist only of lowercase letters.\n\n'

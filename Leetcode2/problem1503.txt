b'You are given an array of strings words (0-indexed).\nIn one operation, pick two distinct indices i and j, where words[i] is a non-empty string, and move any character from words[i] to any position in words[j].\nReturn true if you can make every string in words equal using any number of operations, and false otherwise.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: words = ["abc","aabc","bc"]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Move the first \'a\' in words[1] to the front of words[2],\nto make words[1] = "abc" and words[2] = "abc".\nAll the strings are now equal to "abc", so return true.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: words = ["ab","a"]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: It is impossible to make all the strings equal using the operation.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= words.length <= 100\n1 <= words[i].length <= 100\nwords[i] consists of lowercase English letters.\n\n'

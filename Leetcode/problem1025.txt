b'Given a string s, return the maximum number of ocurrences of any substring under the following rules:\n\nThe number of unique characters in the substring must be less than or equal to maxLetters.\nThe substring size must be between minSize and maxSize inclusive.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "aababcaab", maxLetters = 2, minSize = 3, maxSize = 4\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Substring "aab" has 2 ocurrences in the original string.\nIt satisfies the conditions, 2 unique letters and size 3 (between minSize and maxSize).\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "aaaa", maxLetters = 1, minSize = 3, maxSize = 3\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Substring "aaa" occur 2 times in the string. It can overlap.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 105\n1 <= maxLetters <= 26\n1 <= minSize <= maxSize <= min(26, s.length)\ns consists of only lowercase English letters.\n\n'

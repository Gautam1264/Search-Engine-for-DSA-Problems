b'An integer array original is transformed into a doubled array changed by appending twice the value of every element in original, and then randomly shuffling the resulting array.\nGiven an array changed, return original if changed is a doubled array. If changed is not a doubled array, return an empty array. The elements in original may be returned in any order.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: changed = [1,3,4,2,6,8]\nOutput: [1,3,4]\nExplanation: One possible original array could be [1,3,4]:\n- Twice the value of 1 is 1 * 2 = 2.\n- Twice the value of 3 is 3 * 2 = 6.\n- Twice the value of 4 is 4 * 2 = 8.\nOther original arrays could be [4,3,1] or [3,1,4].\n\nExample 2:\nInput: changed = [6,3,0,1]\nOutput: []\nExplanation: changed is not a doubled array.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: changed = [1]\nOutput: []\nExplanation: changed is not a doubled array.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= changed.length <= 105\n0 <= changed[i] <= 105\n\n'

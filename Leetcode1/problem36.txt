b'Determine if a\xc2\xa09 x 9 Sudoku board\xc2\xa0is valid.\xc2\xa0Only the filled cells need to be validated\xc2\xa0according to the following rules:\n\nEach row\xc2\xa0must contain the\xc2\xa0digits\xc2\xa01-9 without repetition.\nEach column must contain the digits\xc2\xa01-9\xc2\xa0without repetition.\nEach of the nine\xc2\xa03 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits\xc2\xa01-9\xc2\xa0without repetition.\n\nNote:\n\nA Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.\nOnly the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned\xc2\xa0rules.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: board = \n[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]\n,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]\n,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]\n,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]\n,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]\n,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]\n,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]\n,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]\n,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]\nOutput: true\n\nExample 2:\nInput: board = \n[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]\n,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]\n,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]\n,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]\n,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]\n,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]\n,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]\n,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]\n,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8\'s in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nboard.length == 9\nboard[i].length == 9\nboard[i][j] is a digit 1-9 or \'.\'.\n\n'

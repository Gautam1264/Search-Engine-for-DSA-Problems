b'You have k lists of sorted integers in non-decreasing\xc2\xa0order. Find the smallest range that includes at least one number from each of the k lists.\nWe define the range [a, b] is smaller than range [c, d] if b - a < d - c or a < c if b - a == d - c.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [[4,10,15,24,26],[0,9,12,20],[5,18,22,30]]\nOutput: [20,24]\nExplanation: \nList 1: [4, 10, 15, 24,26], 24 is in range [20,24].\nList 2: [0, 9, 12, 20], 20 is in range [20,24].\nList 3: [5, 18, 22, 30], 22 is in range [20,24].\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [[1,2,3],[1,2,3],[1,2,3]]\nOutput: [1,1]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nnums.length == k\n1 <= k <= 3500\n1 <= nums[i].length <= 50\n-105 <= nums[i][j] <= 105\nnums[i]\xc2\xa0is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n'

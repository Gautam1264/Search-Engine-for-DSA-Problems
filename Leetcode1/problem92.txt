b'Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers left and right where left <= right, reverse the nodes of the list from position left to position right, and return the reversed list.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4\nOutput: [1,4,3,2,5]\n\nExample 2:\nInput: head = [5], left = 1, right = 1\nOutput: [5]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the list is n.\n1 <= n <= 500\n-500 <= Node.val <= 500\n1 <= left <= right <= n\n\n\xc2\xa0\nFollow up: Could you do it in one pass?'

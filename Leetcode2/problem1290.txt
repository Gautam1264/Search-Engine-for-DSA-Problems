b'Given a string s, return the length of the longest substring between two equal characters, excluding the two characters. If there is no such substring return -1.\nA substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "aa"\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: The optimal substring here is an empty substring between the two \'a\'s.\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "abca"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The optimal substring here is "bc".\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s = "cbzxy"\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: There are no characters that appear twice in s.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 300\ns contains only lowercase English letters.\n\n'

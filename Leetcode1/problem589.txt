b'You are given a network of n nodes, labeled from 1 to n. You are also given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (ui, vi, wi), where ui is the source node, vi is the target node, and wi is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.\nWe will send a signal from a given node k. Return the time it takes for all the n nodes to receive the signal. If it is impossible for all the n nodes to receive the signal, return -1.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], n = 4, k = 2\nOutput: 2\n\nExample 2:\nInput: times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 1\nOutput: 1\n\nExample 3:\nInput: times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 2\nOutput: -1\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= k <= n <= 100\n1 <= times.length <= 6000\ntimes[i].length == 3\n1 <= ui, vi <= n\nui != vi\n0 <= wi <= 100\nAll the pairs (ui, vi) are unique. (i.e., no multiple edges.)\n\n'

b'An ugly number is a positive integer that is divisible by a, b, or c.\nGiven four integers n, a, b, and c, return the nth ugly number.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 3, a = 2, b = 3, c = 5\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: The ugly numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10... The 3rd is 4.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 4, a = 2, b = 3, c = 4\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The ugly numbers are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12... The 4th is 6.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: n = 5, a = 2, b = 11, c = 13\nOutput: 10\nExplanation: The ugly numbers are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13... The 5th is 10.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n, a, b, c <= 109\n1 <= a * b * c <= 1018\nIt is guaranteed that the result will be in range [1, 2 * 109].\n\n'

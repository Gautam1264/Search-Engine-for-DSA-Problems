b'You are given two jugs with capacities jug1Capacity and jug2Capacity liters. There is an infinite amount of water supply available. Determine whether it is possible to measure exactly targetCapacity liters using these two jugs.\nIf targetCapacity liters of water are measurable, you must have targetCapacity liters of water contained within one or both buckets by the end.\nOperations allowed:\n\nFill any of the jugs with water.\nEmpty any of the jugs.\nPour water from one jug into another till the other jug is completely full, or the first jug itself is empty.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: jug1Capacity = 3, jug2Capacity = 5, targetCapacity = 4\nOutput: true\nExplanation: The famous Die Hard example \n\nExample 2:\nInput: jug1Capacity = 2, jug2Capacity = 6, targetCapacity = 5\nOutput: false\n\nExample 3:\nInput: jug1Capacity = 1, jug2Capacity = 2, targetCapacity = 3\nOutput: true\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= jug1Capacity, jug2Capacity, targetCapacity <= 106\n\n'

b'Given a string s and an array of strings words, return the number of words[i] that is a subsequence of s.\nA subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.\n\nFor example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "abcde", words = ["a","bb","acd","ace"]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: There are three strings in words that are a subsequence of s: "a", "acd", "ace".\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "dsahjpjauf", words = ["ahjpjau","ja","ahbwzgqnuk","tnmlanowax"]\nOutput: 2\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104\n1 <= words.length <= 5000\n1 <= words[i].length <= 50\ns and words[i] consist of only lowercase English letters.\n\n'

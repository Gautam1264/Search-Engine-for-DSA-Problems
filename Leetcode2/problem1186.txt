b"Given a weighted undirected connected graph with n\xc2\xa0vertices numbered from 0 to n - 1,\xc2\xa0and an array edges\xc2\xa0where edges[i] = [ai, bi, weighti] represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between nodes\xc2\xa0ai\xc2\xa0and bi. A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the graph's edges that connects all vertices without cycles\xc2\xa0and with the minimum possible total edge weight.\nFind all the critical and pseudo-critical edges in the given graph's minimum spanning tree (MST). An MST edge whose deletion from the graph would cause the MST weight to increase is called a\xc2\xa0critical edge. On\xc2\xa0the other hand, a pseudo-critical edge is that which can appear in some MSTs but not all.\nNote that you can return the indices of the edges in any order.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,2],[0,3,2],[0,4,3],[3,4,3],[1,4,6]]\nOutput: [[0,1],[2,3,4,5]]\nExplanation: The figure above describes the graph.\nThe following figure shows all the possible MSTs:\n\nNotice that the two edges 0 and 1 appear in all MSTs, therefore they are critical edges, so we return them in the first list of the output.\nThe edges 2, 3, 4, and 5 are only part of some MSTs, therefore they are considered pseudo-critical edges. We add them to the second list of the output.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 4, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,1],[0,3,1]]\nOutput: [[],[0,1,2,3]]\nExplanation: We can observe that since all 4 edges have equal weight, choosing any 3 edges from the given 4 will yield an MST. Therefore all 4 edges are pseudo-critical.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= n <= 100\n1 <= edges.length <= min(200, n * (n - 1) / 2)\nedges[i].length == 3\n0 <= ai < bi < n\n1 <= weighti\xc2\xa0<= 1000\nAll pairs (ai, bi) are distinct.\n\n"

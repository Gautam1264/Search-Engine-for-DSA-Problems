b'There are n cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city a is connected directly with city b, and city b is connected directly with city c, then city a is connected indirectly with city c.\nA province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.\nYou are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1 if the ith city and the jth city are directly connected, and isConnected[i][j] = 0 otherwise.\nReturn the total number of provinces.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]\nOutput: 2\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]\nOutput: 3\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 200\nn == isConnected.length\nn == isConnected[i].length\nisConnected[i][j] is 1 or 0.\nisConnected[i][i] == 1\nisConnected[i][j] == isConnected[j][i]\n\n'

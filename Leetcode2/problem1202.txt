b"Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.\nInitially, there are n stones in a pile. On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of removing any non-zero square number of stones in the pile.\nAlso, if a player cannot make a move, he/she loses the game.\nGiven a positive integer n, return true if and only if Alice wins the game otherwise return false, assuming both players play optimally.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 1\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Alice can remove 1 stone winning the game because Bob doesn't have any moves.\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 2\nOutput: false\nExplanation: Alice can only remove 1 stone, after that Bob removes the last one winning the game (2 -> 1 -> 0).\n\nExample 3:\nInput: n = 4\nOutput: true\nExplanation: n is already a perfect square, Alice can win with one move, removing 4 stones (4 -> 0).\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 105\n\n"

b'You are given an array target and an integer n.\nIn each iteration, you will read a number from list = [1, 2, 3, ..., n].\nBuild the target array using the following operations:\n\n"Push": Reads a new element from the beginning list, and pushes it in the array.\n"Pop": Deletes the last element of the array.\nIf the target array is already built, stop reading more elements.\n\nReturn a list of the operations needed to build target. The test cases are generated so that the answer is unique.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: target = [1,3], n = 3\nOutput: ["Push","Push","Pop","Push"]\nExplanation: \nRead number 1 and automatically push in the array -> [1]\nRead number 2 and automatically push in the array then Pop it -> [1]\nRead number 3 and automatically push in the array -> [1,3]\n\nExample 2:\nInput: target = [1,2,3], n = 3\nOutput: ["Push","Push","Push"]\n\nExample 3:\nInput: target = [1,2], n = 4\nOutput: ["Push","Push"]\nExplanation: You only need to read the first 2 numbers and stop.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= target.length <= 100\n1 <= n <= 100\n1 <= target[i] <= n\ntarget is strictly increasing.\n\n'

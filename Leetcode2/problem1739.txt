b"There is an n x n 0-indexed grid with some artifacts buried in it. You are given the integer n and a 0-indexed 2D integer array artifacts describing the positions of the rectangular artifacts where artifacts[i] = [r1i, c1i, r2i, c2i] denotes that the ith artifact is buried in the subgrid where:\n\n(r1i, c1i) is the coordinate of the top-left cell of the ith artifact and\n(r2i, c2i) is the coordinate of the bottom-right cell of the ith artifact.\n\nYou will excavate some cells of the grid and remove all the mud from them. If the cell has a part of an artifact buried underneath, it will be uncovered. If all the parts of an artifact are uncovered, you can extract it.\nGiven a 0-indexed 2D integer array dig where dig[i] = [ri, ci] indicates that you will excavate the cell (ri, ci), return the number of artifacts that you can extract.\nThe test cases are generated such that:\n\nNo two artifacts overlap.\nEach artifact only covers at most 4 cells.\nThe entries of dig are unique.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 2, artifacts = [[0,0,0,0],[0,1,1,1]], dig = [[0,0],[0,1]]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: \nThe different colors represent different artifacts. Excavated cells are labeled with a 'D' in the grid.\nThere is 1 artifact that can be extracted, namely the red artifact.\nThe blue artifact has one part in cell (1,1) which remains uncovered, so we cannot extract it.\nThus, we return 1.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 2, artifacts = [[0,0,0,0],[0,1,1,1]], dig = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,1]]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Both the red and blue artifacts have all parts uncovered (labeled with a 'D') and can be extracted, so we return 2. \n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 1000\n1 <= artifacts.length, dig.length <= min(n2, 105)\nartifacts[i].length == 4\ndig[i].length == 2\n0 <= r1i, c1i, r2i, c2i, ri, ci <= n - 1\nr1i <= r2i\nc1i <= c2i\nNo two artifacts will overlap.\nThe number of cells covered by an artifact is at most 4.\nThe entries of dig are unique.\n\n"

b'Given an array arr of integers, check if there exists two integers N and M such that N is the double of M ( i.e. N = 2 * M).\nMore formally check if there exists\xc2\xa0two indices i and j such that :\n\ni != j\n0 <= i, j < arr.length\narr[i] == 2 * arr[j]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: arr = [10,2,5,3]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: N = 10 is the double of M = 5,that is, 10 = 2 * 5.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: arr = [7,1,14,11]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: N = 14 is the double of M = 7,that is, 14 = 2 * 7.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: arr = [3,1,7,11]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: In this case does not exist N and M, such that N = 2 * M.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= arr.length <= 500\n-10^3 <= arr[i] <= 10^3\n\n'

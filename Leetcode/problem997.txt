b'Given a 2D\xc2\xa0grid consists of 0s (land)\xc2\xa0and 1s (water).\xc2\xa0 An island is a maximal 4-directionally connected group of 0s and a closed island\xc2\xa0is an island totally\xc2\xa0(all left, top, right, bottom) surrounded by 1s.\nReturn the number of closed islands.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0],[1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: \nIslands in gray are closed because they are completely surrounded by water (group of 1s).\nExample 2:\n\nInput: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,1,0]]\nOutput: 1\n\nExample 3:\nInput: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1],\n\xc2\xa0              [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],\n\xc2\xa0              [1,0,1,1,1,0,1],\n\xc2\xa0              [1,0,1,0,1,0,1],\n\xc2\xa0              [1,0,1,1,1,0,1],\n\xc2\xa0              [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],\n               [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]]\nOutput: 2\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= grid.length, grid[0].length <= 100\n0 <= grid[i][j] <=1\n\n'

b'Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].\nThe product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.\nYou must write an algorithm that runs in\xc2\xa0O(n)\xc2\xa0time and without using the division operation.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4]\nOutput: [24,12,8,6]\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]\nOutput: [0,0,9,0,0]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= nums.length <= 105\n-30 <= nums[i] <= 30\nThe product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nFollow up:\xc2\xa0Can you solve the problem in O(1)\xc2\xa0extra\xc2\xa0space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)\n'

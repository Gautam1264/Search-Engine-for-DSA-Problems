b'Find all valid combinations of k numbers that sum up to n such that the following conditions are true:\n\nOnly numbers 1 through 9 are used.\nEach number is used at most once.\n\nReturn a list of all possible valid combinations. The list must not contain the same combination twice, and the combinations may be returned in any order.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: k = 3, n = 7\nOutput: [[1,2,4]]\nExplanation:\n1 + 2 + 4 = 7\nThere are no other valid combinations.\nExample 2:\nInput: k = 3, n = 9\nOutput: [[1,2,6],[1,3,5],[2,3,4]]\nExplanation:\n1 + 2 + 6 = 9\n1 + 3 + 5 = 9\n2 + 3 + 4 = 9\nThere are no other valid combinations.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: k = 4, n = 1\nOutput: []\nExplanation: There are no valid combinations.\nUsing 4 different numbers in the range [1,9], the smallest sum we can get is 1+2+3+4 = 10 and since 10 > 1, there are no valid combination.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= k <= 9\n1 <= n <= 60\n\n'

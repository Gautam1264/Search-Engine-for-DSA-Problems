b'Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the maximum sum of a non-empty subsequence of that array such that for every two consecutive integers in the subsequence, nums[i] and nums[j], where i < j, the condition j - i <= k is satisfied.\nA subsequence of an array is obtained by deleting some number of elements (can be zero) from the array, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [10,2,-10,5,20], k = 2\nOutput: 37\nExplanation: The subsequence is [10, 2, 5, 20].\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [-1,-2,-3], k = 1\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: The subsequence must be non-empty, so we choose the largest number.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: nums = [10,-2,-10,-5,20], k = 2\nOutput: 23\nExplanation: The subsequence is [10, -2, -5, 20].\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= k <= nums.length <= 105\n-104 <= nums[i] <= 104\n\n'

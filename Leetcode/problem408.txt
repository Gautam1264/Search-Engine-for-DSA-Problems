b'The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.\nYou are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.\nFor each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.\nReturn an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]\nOutput: [-1,3,-1]\nExplanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:\n- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.\n- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.\n- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]\nOutput: [3,-1]\nExplanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:\n- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.\n- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums1.length <= nums2.length <= 1000\n0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 104\nAll integers in nums1 and nums2 are unique.\nAll the integers of nums1 also appear in nums2.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nFollow up: Could you find an O(nums1.length + nums2.length) solution?'

b'Given an undirected tree consisting of n vertices numbered from 0 to n-1, which has some apples in their vertices. You spend 1 second to walk over one edge of the tree. Return the minimum time in seconds you have to spend to collect all apples in the tree, starting at vertex 0 and coming back to this vertex.\nThe edges of the undirected tree are given in the array edges, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] means that exists an edge connecting the vertices ai and bi. Additionally, there is a boolean array hasApple, where hasApple[i] = true means that vertex i has an apple; otherwise, it does not have any apple.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], hasApple = [false,false,true,false,true,true,false]\nOutput: 8 \nExplanation: The figure above represents the given tree where red vertices have an apple. One optimal path to collect all apples is shown by the green arrows.  \n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], hasApple = [false,false,true,false,false,true,false]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The figure above represents the given tree where red vertices have an apple. One optimal path to collect all apples is shown by the green arrows.  \n\nExample 3:\nInput: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], hasApple = [false,false,false,false,false,false,false]\nOutput: 0\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 105\nedges.length == n - 1\nedges[i].length == 2\n0 <= ai < bi <= n - 1\nfromi < toi\nhasApple.length == n\n\n'

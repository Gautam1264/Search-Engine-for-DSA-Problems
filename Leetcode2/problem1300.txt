b'Given two strings s and t, find the number of ways you can choose a non-empty substring of s and replace a single character by a different character such that the resulting substring is a substring of t. In other words, find the number of substrings in s that differ from some substring in t by exactly one character.\nFor example, the underlined substrings in "computer" and "computation" only differ by the \'e\'/\'a\', so this is a valid way.\nReturn the number of substrings that satisfy the condition above.\nA substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "aba", t = "baba"\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The following are the pairs of substrings from s and t that differ by exactly 1 character:\n("aba", "baba")\n("aba", "baba")\n("aba", "baba")\n("aba", "baba")\n("aba", "baba")\n("aba", "baba")\nThe underlined portions are the substrings that are chosen from s and t.\n\n\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bExample 2:\nInput: s = "ab", t = "bb"\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The following are the pairs of substrings from s and t that differ by 1 character:\n("ab", "bb")\n("ab", "bb")\n("ab", "bb")\n\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bThe underlined portions are the substrings that are chosen from s and t.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length, t.length <= 100\ns and t consist of lowercase English letters only.\n\n'

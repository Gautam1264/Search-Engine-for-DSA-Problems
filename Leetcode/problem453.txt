b'Given a positive integer n, find the smallest integer which has exactly the same digits existing in the integer n and is greater in value than n. If no such positive integer exists, return -1.\nNote that the returned integer should fit in 32-bit integer, if there is a valid answer but it does not fit in 32-bit integer, return -1.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 12\nOutput: 21\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 21\nOutput: -1\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 231 - 1\n\n'

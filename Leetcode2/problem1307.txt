b'A string s is called good if there are no two different characters in s that have the same frequency.\nGiven a string s, return the minimum number of characters you need to delete to make s good.\nThe frequency of a character in a string is the number of times it appears in the string. For example, in the string "aab", the frequency of \'a\' is 2, while the frequency of \'b\' is 1.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "aab"\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: s is already good.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "aaabbbcc"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: You can delete two \'b\'s resulting in the good string "aaabcc".\nAnother way it to delete one \'b\' and one \'c\' resulting in the good string "aaabbc".\nExample 3:\nInput: s = "ceabaacb"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: You can delete both \'c\'s resulting in the good string "eabaab".\nNote that we only care about characters that are still in the string at the end (i.e. frequency of 0 is ignored).\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 105\ns\xc2\xa0contains only lowercase English letters.\n\n'

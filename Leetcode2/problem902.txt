b'Given two strings str1 and str2, return the shortest string that has both str1 and str2 as subsequences. If there are multiple valid strings, return any of them.\nA string s is a subsequence of string t if deleting some number of characters from t (possibly 0) results in the string s.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: str1 = "abac", str2 = "cab"\nOutput: "cabac"\nExplanation: \nstr1 = "abac" is a subsequence of "cabac" because we can delete the first "c".\nstr2 = "cab" is a subsequence of "cabac" because we can delete the last "ac".\nThe answer provided is the shortest such string that satisfies these properties.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: str1 = "aaaaaaaa", str2 = "aaaaaaaa"\nOutput: "aaaaaaaa"\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= str1.length, str2.length <= 1000\nstr1 and str2 consist of lowercase English letters.\n\n'

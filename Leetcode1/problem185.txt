b'Given a text file file.txt that contains a list of phone numbers (one per line), write a one-liner bash script to print all valid phone numbers.\nYou may assume that a valid phone number must appear in one of the following two formats: (xxx) xxx-xxxx or xxx-xxx-xxxx. (x means a digit)\nYou may also assume each line in the text file must not contain leading or trailing white spaces.\nExample:\nAssume that file.txt has the following content:\n987-123-4567\n123 456 7890\n(123) 456-7890\n\nYour script should output the following valid phone numbers:\n987-123-4567\n(123) 456-7890\n\n'

b'A cell (r, c) of an excel sheet is represented as a string "<col><row>" where:\n\n<col> denotes the column number c of the cell. It is represented by alphabetical letters.\n\n\t\nFor example, the 1st column is denoted by \'A\', the 2nd by \'B\', the 3rd by \'C\', and so on.\n\n\n<row> is the row number r of the cell. The rth row is represented by the integer r.\n\nYou are given a string s\xc2\xa0in\xc2\xa0the format "<col1><row1>:<col2><row2>", where <col1> represents the column c1, <row1> represents the row r1, <col2> represents the column c2, and <row2> represents the row r2, such that r1 <= r2 and c1 <= c2.\nReturn the list of cells (x, y) such that r1 <= x <= r2 and c1 <= y <= c2. The cells should be represented as\xc2\xa0strings in the format mentioned above and be sorted in non-decreasing order first by columns and then by rows.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = "K1:L2"\nOutput: ["K1","K2","L1","L2"]\nExplanation:\nThe above diagram shows the cells which should be present in the list.\nThe red arrows denote the order in which the cells should be presented.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = "A1:F1"\nOutput: ["A1","B1","C1","D1","E1","F1"]\nExplanation:\nThe above diagram shows the cells which should be present in the list.\nThe red arrow denotes the order in which the cells should be presented.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\ns.length == 5\n\'A\' <= s[0] <= s[3] <= \'Z\'\n\'1\' <= s[1] <= s[4] <= \'9\'\ns consists of uppercase English letters, digits and \':\'.\n\n'

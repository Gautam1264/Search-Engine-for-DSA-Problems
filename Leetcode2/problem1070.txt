b'Given a m\xc2\xa0* n\xc2\xa0matrix seats\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0that represent seats distributions\xc2\xa0in a classroom.\xc2\xa0If a seat\xc2\xa0is\xc2\xa0broken, it is denoted by \'#\' character otherwise it is denoted by a \'.\' character.\nStudents can see the answers of those sitting next to the left, right, upper left and upper right, but he cannot see the answers of the student sitting\xc2\xa0directly in front or behind him. Return the maximum number of students that can take the exam together\xc2\xa0without any cheating being possible..\nStudents must be placed in seats in good condition.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: seats = [["#",".","#","#",".","#"],\n\xc2\xa0               [".","#","#","#","#","."],\n\xc2\xa0               ["#",".","#","#",".","#"]]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: Teacher can place 4 students in available seats so they don\'t cheat on the exam. \n\nExample 2:\nInput: seats = [[".","#"],\n\xc2\xa0               ["#","#"],\n\xc2\xa0               ["#","."],\n\xc2\xa0               ["#","#"],\n\xc2\xa0               [".","#"]]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Place all students in available seats. \n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: seats = [["#",".",".",".","#"],\n\xc2\xa0               [".","#",".","#","."],\n\xc2\xa0               [".",".","#",".","."],\n\xc2\xa0               [".","#",".","#","."],\n\xc2\xa0               ["#",".",".",".","#"]]\nOutput: 10\nExplanation: Place students in available seats in column 1, 3 and 5.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nseats\xc2\xa0contains only characters\xc2\xa0\'.\'\xc2\xa0and\'#\'.\nm ==\xc2\xa0seats.length\nn ==\xc2\xa0seats[i].length\n1 <= m <= 8\n1 <= n <= 8\n\n'

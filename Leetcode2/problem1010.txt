b'You are given a string s containing lowercase letters and an integer k. You need to :\n\nFirst, change some characters of s to other lowercase English letters.\nThen divide s into k non-empty disjoint substrings such that each substring is a palindrome.\n\nReturn the minimal number of characters that you need to change to divide the string.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "abc", k = 2\nOutput: 1\nExplanation:\xc2\xa0You can split the string into "ab" and "c", and change 1 character in "ab" to make it palindrome.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "aabbc", k = 3\nOutput: 0\nExplanation:\xc2\xa0You can split the string into "aa", "bb" and "c", all of them are palindrome.\nExample 3:\nInput: s = "leetcode", k = 8\nOutput: 0\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= k <= s.length <= 100.\ns only contains lowercase English letters.\n\n'

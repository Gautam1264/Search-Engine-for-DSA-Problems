b'The product difference between two pairs (a, b) and (c, d) is defined as (a * b) - (c * d).\n\nFor example, the product difference between (5, 6) and (2, 7) is (5 * 6) - (2 * 7) = 16.\n\nGiven an integer array nums, choose four distinct indices w, x, y, and z such that the product difference between pairs (nums[w], nums[x]) and (nums[y], nums[z]) is maximized.\nReturn the maximum such product difference.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [5,6,2,7,4]\nOutput: 34\nExplanation: We can choose indices 1 and 3 for the first pair (6, 7) and indices 2 and 4 for the second pair (2, 4).\nThe product difference is (6 * 7) - (2 * 4) = 34.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [4,2,5,9,7,4,8]\nOutput: 64\nExplanation: We can choose indices 3 and 6 for the first pair (9, 8) and indices 1 and 5 for the second pair (2, 4).\nThe product difference is (9 * 8) - (2 * 4) = 64.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n4 <= nums.length <= 104\n1 <= nums[i] <= 104\n'

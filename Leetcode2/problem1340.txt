b'A decimal number is called deci-binary if each of its digits is either 0 or 1 without any leading zeros. For example, 101 and 1100 are deci-binary, while 112 and 3001 are not.\nGiven a string n that represents a positive decimal integer, return the minimum number of positive deci-binary numbers needed so that they sum up to n.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = "32"\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: 10 + 11 + 11 = 32\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = "82734"\nOutput: 8\n\nExample 3:\nInput: n = "27346209830709182346"\nOutput: 9\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n.length <= 105\nn consists of only digits.\nn does not contain any leading zeros and represents a positive integer.\n\n'

b'You are given an m x n grid. Each cell of grid represents a street. The street of grid[i][j] can be:\n\n1 which means a street connecting the left cell and the right cell.\n2 which means a street connecting the upper cell and the lower cell.\n3 which means a street connecting the left cell and the lower cell.\n4 which means a street connecting the right cell and the lower cell.\n5 which means a street connecting the left cell and the upper cell.\n6 which means a street connecting the right cell and the upper cell.\n\n\nYou will initially start at the street of the upper-left cell (0, 0). A valid path in the grid is a path that starts from the upper left cell (0, 0) and ends at the bottom-right cell (m - 1, n - 1). The path should only follow the streets.\nNotice that you are not allowed to change any street.\nReturn true if there is a valid path in the grid or false otherwise.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: grid = [[2,4,3],[6,5,2]]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: As shown you can start at cell (0, 0) and visit all the cells of the grid to reach (m - 1, n - 1).\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: grid = [[1,2,1],[1,2,1]]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: As shown you the street at cell (0, 0) is not connected with any street of any other cell and you will get stuck at cell (0, 0)\n\nExample 3:\nInput: grid = [[1,1,2]]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: You will get stuck at cell (0, 1) and you cannot reach cell (0, 2).\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nm == grid.length\nn == grid[i].length\n1 <= m, n <= 300\n1 <= grid[i][j] <= 6\n\n'

b'A bus\xc2\xa0has n stops numbered from 0 to n - 1 that form\xc2\xa0a circle. We know the distance between all pairs of neighboring stops where distance[i] is the distance between the stops number\xc2\xa0i and (i + 1) % n.\nThe bus goes along both directions\xc2\xa0i.e. clockwise and counterclockwise.\nReturn the shortest distance between the given\xc2\xa0start\xc2\xa0and destination\xc2\xa0stops.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 1\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: Distance between 0 and 1 is 1 or 9, minimum is 1.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 2:\n\nInput: distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 2\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Distance between 0 and 2 is 3 or 7, minimum is 3.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 3:\n\nInput: distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 3\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: Distance between 0 and 3 is 6 or 4, minimum is 4.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n\xc2\xa0<= 10^4\ndistance.length == n\n0 <= start, destination < n\n0 <= distance[i] <= 10^4\n'

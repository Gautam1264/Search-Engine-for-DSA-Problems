b'You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum\xc2\xa0as a linked list.\nYou may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]\nOutput: [7,0,8]\nExplanation: 342 + 465 = 807.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]\nOutput: [0]\n\nExample 3:\nInput: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]\nOutput: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].\n0 <= Node.val <= 9\nIt is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.\n\n'

b'There is a directed graph of n nodes with each node labeled from 0 to n - 1. The graph is represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array graph where graph[i] is an integer array of nodes adjacent to node i, meaning there is an edge from node i to each node in graph[i].\nA node is a terminal node if there are no outgoing edges. A node is a safe node if every possible path starting from that node leads to a terminal node.\nReturn an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph. The answer should be sorted in ascending order.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]\nOutput: [2,4,5,6]\nExplanation: The given graph is shown above.\nNodes 5 and 6 are terminal nodes as there are no outgoing edges from either of them.\nEvery path starting at nodes 2, 4, 5, and 6 all lead to either node 5 or 6.\nExample 2:\nInput: graph = [[1,2,3,4],[1,2],[3,4],[0,4],[]]\nOutput: [4]\nExplanation:\nOnly node 4 is a terminal node, and every path starting at node 4 leads to node 4.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nn == graph.length\n1 <= n <= 104\n0 <= graph[i].length <= n\n0 <= graph[i][j] <= n - 1\ngraph[i] is sorted in a strictly increasing order.\nThe graph may contain self-loops.\nThe number of edges in the graph will be in the range [1, 4 * 104].\n\n'

b'Given a string n representing an integer, return the closest integer (not including itself), which is a palindrome. If there is a tie, return the smaller one.\nThe closest is defined as the absolute difference minimized between two integers.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = "123"\nOutput: "121"\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = "1"\nOutput: "0"\nExplanation: 0 and 2 are the closest palindromes but we return the smallest which is 0.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n.length <= 18\nn consists of only digits.\nn does not have leading zeros.\nn is representing an integer in the range [1, 1018 - 1].\n\n'

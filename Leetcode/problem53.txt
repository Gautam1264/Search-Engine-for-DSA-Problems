b'Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.\nA subarray is a contiguous part of an array.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [1]\nOutput: 1\n\nExample 3:\nInput: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]\nOutput: 23\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 105\n-104 <= nums[i] <= 104\n\n\xc2\xa0\nFollow up: If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.\n'

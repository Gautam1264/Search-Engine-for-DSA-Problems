b'You are given a 2D integer array items where items[i] = [pricei, beautyi] denotes the price and beauty of an item respectively.\nYou are also given a 0-indexed integer array queries. For each queries[j], you want to determine the maximum beauty of an item whose price is less than or equal to queries[j]. If no such item exists, then the answer to this query is 0.\nReturn an array answer of the same length as queries where answer[j] is the answer to the jth query.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: items = [[1,2],[3,2],[2,4],[5,6],[3,5]], queries = [1,2,3,4,5,6]\nOutput: [2,4,5,5,6,6]\nExplanation:\n- For queries[0]=1, [1,2] is the only item which has price <= 1. Hence, the answer for this query is 2.\n- For queries[1]=2, the items which can be considered are [1,2] and [2,4]. \n  The maximum beauty among them is 4.\n- For queries[2]=3 and queries[3]=4, the items which can be considered are [1,2], [3,2], [2,4], and [3,5].\n  The maximum beauty among them is 5.\n- For queries[4]=5 and queries[5]=6, all items can be considered.\n  Hence, the answer for them is the maximum beauty of all items, i.e., 6.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: items = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4]], queries = [1]\nOutput: [4]\nExplanation: \nThe price of every item is equal to 1, so we choose the item with the maximum beauty 4. \nNote that multiple items can have the same price and/or beauty.  \n\nExample 3:\nInput: items = [[10,1000]], queries = [5]\nOutput: [0]\nExplanation:\nNo item has a price less than or equal to 5, so no item can be chosen.\nHence, the answer to the query is 0.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= items.length, queries.length <= 105\nitems[i].length == 2\n1 <= pricei, beautyi, queries[j] <= 109\n\n'

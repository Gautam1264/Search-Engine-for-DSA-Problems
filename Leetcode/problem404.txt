b"A web developer needs to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web page\xe2\x80\x99s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:\n\nThe area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.\nThe width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.\nThe difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.\n\nReturn an array [L, W] where L and W are the length and width of the\xc2\xa0web page you designed in sequence.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: area = 4\nOutput: [2,2]\nExplanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. \nBut according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: area = 37\nOutput: [37,1]\n\nExample 3:\nInput: area = 122122\nOutput: [427,286]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= area <= 107\n\n"

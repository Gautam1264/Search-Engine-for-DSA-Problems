b'You are standing at position 0 on an infinite number line. There is a destination at position target.\nYou can make some number of moves numMoves so that:\n\nOn each move, you can either go left or right.\nDuring the ith move (starting from i == 1 to i == numMoves), you take i steps in the chosen direction.\n\nGiven the integer target, return the minimum number of moves required (i.e., the minimum numMoves) to reach the destination.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: target = 2\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:\nOn the 1st move, we step from 0 to 1 (1 step).\nOn the 2nd move, we step from 1 to -1 (2 steps).\nOn the 3rd move, we step from -1 to 2 (3 steps).\n\nExample 2:\nInput: target = 3\nOutput: 2\nExplanation:\nOn the 1st move, we step from 0 to 1 (1 step).\nOn the 2nd move, we step from 1 to 3 (2 steps).\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n-109 <= target <= 109\ntarget != 0\n\n'

b"Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.\nReturn a deep copy (clone) of the graph.\nEach node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.\nclass Node {\n    public int val;\n    public List<Node> neighbors;\n}\n\n\xc2\xa0\nTest case format:\nFor simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.\nAn adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.\nThe given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]\nOutput: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]\nExplanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.\n1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).\n2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).\n3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).\n4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: adjList = [[]]\nOutput: [[]]\nExplanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: adjList = []\nOutput: []\nExplanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the graph is in the range [0, 100].\n1 <= Node.val <= 100\nNode.val is unique for each node.\nThere are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.\nThe Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.\n\n"

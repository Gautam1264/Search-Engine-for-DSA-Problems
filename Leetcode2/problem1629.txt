b'An original string, consisting of lowercase English letters, can be encoded by the following steps:\n\nArbitrarily split it into a sequence of some number of non-empty substrings.\nArbitrarily choose some elements (possibly none) of the sequence, and replace each with its length (as a numeric string).\nConcatenate the sequence as the encoded string.\n\nFor example, one way to encode an original string "abcdefghijklmnop" might be:\n\nSplit it as a sequence: ["ab", "cdefghijklmn", "o", "p"].\nChoose the second and third elements to be replaced by their lengths, respectively. The sequence becomes ["ab", "12", "1", "p"].\nConcatenate the elements of the sequence to get the encoded string: "ab121p".\n\nGiven two encoded strings s1 and s2, consisting of lowercase English letters and digits 1-9 (inclusive), return true if there exists an original string that could be encoded as both s1 and s2. Otherwise, return false.\nNote: The test cases are generated such that the number of consecutive digits in s1 and s2 does not exceed 3.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s1 = "internationalization", s2 = "i18n"\nOutput: true\nExplanation: It is possible that "internationalization" was the original string.\n- "internationalization" \n  -> Split:       ["internationalization"]\n  -> Do not replace any element\n  -> Concatenate:  "internationalization", which is s1.\n- "internationalization"\n  -> Split:       ["i", "nternationalizatio", "n"]\n  -> Replace:     ["i", "18",                 "n"]\n  -> Concatenate:  "i18n", which is s2\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s1 = "l123e", s2 = "44"\nOutput: true\nExplanation: It is possible that "leetcode" was the original string.\n- "leetcode" \n  -> Split:      ["l", "e", "et", "cod", "e"]\n  -> Replace:    ["l", "1", "2",  "3",   "e"]\n  -> Concatenate: "l123e", which is s1.\n- "leetcode" \n  -> Split:      ["leet", "code"]\n  -> Replace:    ["4",    "4"]\n  -> Concatenate: "44", which is s2.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s1 = "a5b", s2 = "c5b"\nOutput: false\nExplanation: It is impossible.\n- The original string encoded as s1 must start with the letter \'a\'.\n- The original string encoded as s2 must start with the letter \'c\'.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 40\ns1 and s2 consist of digits 1-9 (inclusive), and lowercase English letters only.\nThe number of consecutive digits in s1 and s2 does not exceed 3.\n\n'

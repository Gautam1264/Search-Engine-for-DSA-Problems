b'Given the root of a binary tree, return the same tree where every subtree (of the given tree) not containing a 1 has been removed.\nA subtree of a node node is node plus every node that is a descendant of node.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [1,null,0,0,1]\nOutput: [1,null,0,null,1]\nExplanation: \nOnly the red nodes satisfy the property "every subtree not containing a 1".\nThe diagram on the right represents the answer.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [1,0,1,0,0,0,1]\nOutput: [1,null,1,null,1]\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: root = [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0]\nOutput: [1,1,0,1,1,null,1]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 200].\nNode.val is either 0 or 1.\n\n'

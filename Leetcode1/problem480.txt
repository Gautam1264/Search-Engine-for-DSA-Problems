b"You are given an m x n matrix M initialized with all 0's and an array of operations ops, where ops[i] = [ai, bi] means M[x][y] should be incremented by one for all 0 <= x < ai and 0 <= y < bi.\nCount and return the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: m = 3, n = 3, ops = [[2,2],[3,3]]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: The maximum integer in M is 2, and there are four of it in M. So return 4.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: m = 3, n = 3, ops = [[2,2],[3,3],[3,3],[3,3],[2,2],[3,3],[3,3],[3,3],[2,2],[3,3],[3,3],[3,3]]\nOutput: 4\n\nExample 3:\nInput: m = 3, n = 3, ops = []\nOutput: 9\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= m, n <= 4 * 104\n0 <= ops.length <= 104\nops[i].length == 2\n1 <= ai <= m\n1 <= bi <= n\n\n"

b"Given an array of integers, return the maximum sum for a non-empty\xc2\xa0subarray (contiguous elements) with at most one element deletion.\xc2\xa0In other words, you want to choose a subarray and optionally delete one element from it so that there is still at least one element left and the\xc2\xa0sum of the remaining elements is maximum possible.\nNote that the subarray needs to be non-empty after deleting one element.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: arr = [1,-2,0,3]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: Because we can choose [1, -2, 0, 3] and drop -2, thus the subarray [1, 0, 3] becomes the maximum value.\nExample 2:\nInput: arr = [1,-2,-2,3]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: We just choose [3] and it's the maximum sum.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: arr = [-1,-1,-1,-1]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation:\xc2\xa0The final subarray needs to be non-empty. You can't choose [-1] and delete -1 from it, then get an empty subarray to make the sum equals to 0.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= arr.length <= 105\n-104 <= arr[i] <= 104\n\n"

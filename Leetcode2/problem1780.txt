b'You are given a string array words and a string s, where words[i] and s comprise only of lowercase English letters.\nReturn the number of strings in words that are a prefix of s.\nA prefix of a string is a substring that occurs at the beginning of the string. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: words = ["a","b","c","ab","bc","abc"], s = "abc"\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:\nThe strings in words which are a prefix of s = "abc" are:\n"a", "ab", and "abc".\nThus the number of strings in words which are a prefix of s is 3.\nExample 2:\nInput: words = ["a","a"], s = "aa"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation:\nBoth of the strings are a prefix of s. \nNote that the same string can occur multiple times in words, and it should be counted each time.\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= words.length <= 1000\n1 <= words[i].length, s.length <= 10\nwords[i] and s consist of lowercase English letters only.\n\n'

b'There is a row of m houses in a small city, each house must be painted with one of the n colors (labeled from 1 to n), some houses that have been painted last summer should not be painted again.\nA neighborhood is a maximal group of continuous houses that are painted with the same color.\n\nFor example: houses = [1,2,2,3,3,2,1,1] contains 5 neighborhoods [{1}, {2,2}, {3,3}, {2}, {1,1}].\n\nGiven an array houses, an m x n matrix cost and an integer target where:\n\nhouses[i]: is the color of the house i, and 0 if the house is not painted yet.\ncost[i][j]: is the cost of paint the house i with the color j + 1.\n\nReturn the minimum cost of painting all the remaining houses in such a way that there are exactly target neighborhoods. If it is not possible, return -1.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: houses = [0,0,0,0,0], cost = [[1,10],[10,1],[10,1],[1,10],[5,1]], m = 5, n = 2, target = 3\nOutput: 9\nExplanation: Paint houses of this way [1,2,2,1,1]\nThis array contains target = 3 neighborhoods, [{1}, {2,2}, {1,1}].\nCost of paint all houses (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 5) = 9.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: houses = [0,2,1,2,0], cost = [[1,10],[10,1],[10,1],[1,10],[5,1]], m = 5, n = 2, target = 3\nOutput: 11\nExplanation: Some houses are already painted, Paint the houses of this way [2,2,1,2,2]\nThis array contains target = 3 neighborhoods, [{2,2}, {1}, {2,2}]. \nCost of paint the first and last house (10 + 1) = 11.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: houses = [3,1,2,3], cost = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]], m = 4, n = 3, target = 3\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: Houses are already painted with a total of 4 neighborhoods [{3},{1},{2},{3}] different of target = 3.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nm == houses.length == cost.length\nn == cost[i].length\n1 <= m <= 100\n1 <= n <= 20\n1 <= target <= m\n0 <= houses[i] <= n\n1 <= cost[i][j] <= 104\n\n'

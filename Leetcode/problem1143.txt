b"Given an binary array nums and an integer k, return true if all 1's are at least k places away from each other, otherwise return false.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1], k = 2\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Each of the 1s are at least 2 places away from each other.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,0,0,1,0,1], k = 2\nOutput: false\nExplanation: The second 1 and third 1 are only one apart from each other.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 105\n0 <= k <= nums.length\nnums[i] is 0 or 1\n\n"

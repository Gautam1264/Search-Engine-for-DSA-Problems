b'Given two strings s1 and\xc2\xa0s2, return the lowest ASCII sum of deleted characters to make two strings equal.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s1 = "sea", s2 = "eat"\nOutput: 231\nExplanation: Deleting "s" from "sea" adds the ASCII value of "s" (115) to the sum.\nDeleting "t" from "eat" adds 116 to the sum.\nAt the end, both strings are equal, and 115 + 116 = 231 is the minimum sum possible to achieve this.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s1 = "delete", s2 = "leet"\nOutput: 403\nExplanation: Deleting "dee" from "delete" to turn the string into "let",\nadds 100[d] + 101[e] + 101[e] to the sum.\nDeleting "e" from "leet" adds 101[e] to the sum.\nAt the end, both strings are equal to "let", and the answer is 100+101+101+101 = 403.\nIf instead we turned both strings into "lee" or "eet", we would get answers of 433 or 417, which are higher.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 1000\ns1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters.\n\n'

b'You are given a positive integer n representing the number of nodes of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). The nodes are numbered from 0 to n - 1 (inclusive).\nYou are also given a 2D integer array edges, where edges[i] = [fromi, toi] denotes that there is a unidirectional edge from fromi to toi in the graph.\nReturn a list answer, where answer[i] is the list of ancestors of the ith node, sorted in ascending order.\nA node u is an ancestor of another node v if u can reach v via a set of edges.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 8, edgeList = [[0,3],[0,4],[1,3],[2,4],[2,7],[3,5],[3,6],[3,7],[4,6]]\nOutput: [[],[],[],[0,1],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,1,2,3,4],[0,1,2,3]]\nExplanation:\nThe above diagram represents the input graph.\n- Nodes 0, 1, and 2 do not have any ancestors.\n- Node 3 has two ancestors 0 and 1.\n- Node 4 has two ancestors 0 and 2.\n- Node 5 has three ancestors 0, 1, and 3.\n- Node 6 has five ancestors 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n- Node 7 has four ancestors 0, 1, 2, and 3.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 5, edgeList = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[0,4],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4]]\nOutput: [[],[0],[0,1],[0,1,2],[0,1,2,3]]\nExplanation:\nThe above diagram represents the input graph.\n- Node 0 does not have any ancestor.\n- Node 1 has one ancestor 0.\n- Node 2 has two ancestors 0 and 1.\n- Node 3 has three ancestors 0, 1, and 2.\n- Node 4 has four ancestors 0, 1, 2, and 3.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 1000\n0 <= edges.length <= min(2000, n * (n - 1) / 2)\nedges[i].length == 2\n0 <= fromi, toi <= n - 1\nfromi != toi\nThere are no duplicate edges.\nThe graph is directed and acyclic.\n\n'

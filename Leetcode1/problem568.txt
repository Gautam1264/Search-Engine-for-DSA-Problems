b'We have two special characters:\n\nThe first character can be represented by one bit 0.\nThe second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).\n\nGiven a binary array bits that ends with 0, return true if the last character must be a one-bit character.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: bits = [1,0,0]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character.\nSo the last character is one-bit character.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: bits = [1,1,1,0]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character.\nSo the last character is not one-bit character.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= bits.length <= 1000\nbits[i] is either 0 or 1.\n\n'

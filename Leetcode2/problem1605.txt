b'You are given a string s, an integer k, a letter letter, and an integer repetition.\nReturn the lexicographically smallest subsequence of s of length k that has the letter letter appear at least repetition times. The test cases are generated so that the letter appears in s at least repetition times.\nA subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.\nA string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if in the first position where a and b differ, string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "leet", k = 3, letter = "e", repetition = 1\nOutput: "eet"\nExplanation: There are four subsequences of length 3 that have the letter \'e\' appear at least 1 time:\n- "lee" (from "leet")\n- "let" (from "leet")\n- "let" (from "leet")\n- "eet" (from "leet")\nThe lexicographically smallest subsequence among them is "eet".\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = "leetcode", k = 4, letter = "e", repetition = 2\nOutput: "ecde"\nExplanation: "ecde" is the lexicographically smallest subsequence of length 4 that has the letter "e" appear at least 2 times.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s = "bb", k = 2, letter = "b", repetition = 2\nOutput: "bb"\nExplanation: "bb" is the only subsequence of length 2 that has the letter "b" appear at least 2 times.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= repetition <= k <= s.length <= 5 * 104\ns consists of lowercase English letters.\nletter is a lowercase English letter, and appears in s at least repetition times.\n\n'

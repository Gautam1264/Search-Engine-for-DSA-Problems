b'Given an integer array nums where\xc2\xa0every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.\nYou must\xc2\xa0implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use\xc2\xa0only constant\xc2\xa0extra space.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [2,2,3,2]\nOutput: 3\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]\nOutput: 99\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104\n-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1\nEach element in nums appears exactly three times except for one element which appears once.\n\n'

b'You are given an integer n, which indicates that there are n courses labeled from 1 to n. You are also given a 2D integer array relations where relations[j] = [prevCoursej, nextCoursej] denotes that course prevCoursej has to be completed before course nextCoursej (prerequisite relationship). Furthermore, you are given a 0-indexed integer array time where time[i] denotes how many months it takes to complete the (i+1)th course.\nYou must find the minimum number of months needed to complete all the courses following these rules:\n\nYou may start taking a course at any time if the prerequisites are met.\nAny number of courses can be taken at the same time.\n\nReturn the minimum number of months needed to complete all the courses.\nNote: The test cases are generated such that it is possible to complete every course (i.e., the graph is a directed acyclic graph).\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 3, relations = [[1,3],[2,3]], time = [3,2,5]\nOutput: 8\nExplanation: The figure above represents the given graph and the time required to complete each course. \nWe start course 1 and course 2 simultaneously at month 0.\nCourse 1 takes 3 months and course 2 takes 2 months to complete respectively.\nThus, the earliest time we can start course 3 is at month 3, and the total time required is 3 + 5 = 8 months.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 5, relations = [[1,5],[2,5],[3,5],[3,4],[4,5]], time = [1,2,3,4,5]\nOutput: 12\nExplanation: The figure above represents the given graph and the time required to complete each course.\nYou can start courses 1, 2, and 3 at month 0.\nYou can complete them after 1, 2, and 3 months respectively.\nCourse 4 can be taken only after course 3 is completed, i.e., after 3 months. It is completed after 3 + 4 = 7 months.\nCourse 5 can be taken only after courses 1, 2, 3, and 4 have been completed, i.e., after max(1,2,3,7) = 7 months.\nThus, the minimum time needed to complete all the courses is 7 + 5 = 12 months.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 5 * 104\n0 <= relations.length <= min(n * (n - 1) / 2, 5 * 104)\nrelations[j].length == 2\n1 <= prevCoursej, nextCoursej <= n\nprevCoursej != nextCoursej\nAll the pairs [prevCoursej, nextCoursej] are unique.\ntime.length == n\n1 <= time[i] <= 104\nThe given graph is a directed acyclic graph.\n\n'

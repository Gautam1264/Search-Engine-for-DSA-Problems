b'In a project, you have a list of required skills req_skills, and a list of people. The ith person people[i] contains a list of skills that the person has.\nConsider a sufficient team: a set of people such that for every required skill in req_skills, there is at least one person in the team who has that skill. We can represent these teams by the index of each person.\n\nFor example, team = [0, 1, 3] represents the people with skills people[0], people[1], and people[3].\n\nReturn any sufficient team of the smallest possible size, represented by the index of each person. You may return the answer in any order.\nIt is guaranteed an answer exists.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: req_skills = ["java","nodejs","reactjs"], people = [["java"],["nodejs"],["nodejs","reactjs"]]\nOutput: [0,2]\nExample 2:\nInput: req_skills = ["algorithms","math","java","reactjs","csharp","aws"], people = [["algorithms","math","java"],["algorithms","math","reactjs"],["java","csharp","aws"],["reactjs","csharp"],["csharp","math"],["aws","java"]]\nOutput: [1,2]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= req_skills.length <= 16\n1 <= req_skills[i].length <= 16\nreq_skills[i] consists of lowercase English letters.\nAll the strings of req_skills are unique.\n1 <= people.length <= 60\n0 <= people[i].length <= 16\n1 <= people[i][j].length <= 16\npeople[i][j] consists of lowercase English letters.\nAll the strings of people[i] are unique.\nEvery skill in people[i] is a skill in req_skills.\nIt is guaranteed a sufficient team exists.\n\n'

b'You are given a string s.\nA split is called good if you can split s into two non-empty strings sleft and sright where their concatenation is equal to s (i.e., sleft + sright = s) and the number of distinct letters in sleft and sright is the same.\nReturn the number of good splits you can make in s.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "aacaba"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: There are 5 ways to split "aacaba" and 2 of them are good. \n("a", "acaba") Left string and right string contains 1 and 3 different letters respectively.\n("aa", "caba") Left string and right string contains 1 and 3 different letters respectively.\n("aac", "aba") Left string and right string contains 2 and 2 different letters respectively (good split).\n("aaca", "ba") Left string and right string contains 2 and 2 different letters respectively (good split).\n("aacab", "a") Left string and right string contains 3 and 1 different letters respectively.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "abcd"\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: Split the string as follows ("ab", "cd").\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 105\ns consists of only lowercase English letters.\n\n'

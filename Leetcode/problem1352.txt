b'You are given a string s of even length. Split this string into two halves of equal lengths, and let a be the first half and b be the second half.\nTwo strings are alike if they have the same number of vowels (\'a\', \'e\', \'i\', \'o\', \'u\', \'A\', \'E\', \'I\', \'O\', \'U\'). Notice that s contains uppercase and lowercase letters.\nReturn true if a and b are alike. Otherwise, return false.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "book"\nOutput: true\nExplanation: a = "bo" and b = "ok". a has 1 vowel and b has 1 vowel. Therefore, they are alike.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "textbook"\nOutput: false\nExplanation: a = "text" and b = "book". a has 1 vowel whereas b has 2. Therefore, they are not alike.\nNotice that the vowel o is counted twice.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= s.length <= 1000\ns.length is even.\ns consists of uppercase and lowercase letters.\n\n'

b'You are given two strings, word1 and word2. You want to construct a string in the following manner:\n\nChoose some non-empty subsequence subsequence1 from word1.\nChoose some non-empty subsequence subsequence2 from word2.\nConcatenate the subsequences: subsequence1 + subsequence2, to make the string.\n\nReturn the length of the longest palindrome that can be constructed in the described manner. If no palindromes can be constructed, return 0.\nA subsequence of a string s is a string that can be made by deleting some (possibly none) characters from s without changing the order of the remaining characters.\nA palindrome is a string that reads the same forward\xc2\xa0as well as backward.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: word1 = "cacb", word2 = "cbba"\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: Choose "ab" from word1 and "cba" from word2 to make "abcba", which is a palindrome.\nExample 2:\nInput: word1 = "ab", word2 = "ab"\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Choose "ab" from word1 and "a" from word2 to make "aba", which is a palindrome.\nExample 3:\nInput: word1 = "aa", word2 = "bb"\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: You cannot construct a palindrome from the described method, so return 0.\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 1000\nword1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.\n\n'

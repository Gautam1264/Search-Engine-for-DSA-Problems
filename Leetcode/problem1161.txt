b'Given two arrays nums1\xc2\xa0and nums2.\nReturn the maximum dot product\xc2\xa0between\xc2\xa0non-empty subsequences of nums1 and nums2 with the same length.\nA subsequence of a array is a new array which is formed from the original array by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie,\xc2\xa0[2,3,5]\xc2\xa0is a subsequence of\xc2\xa0[1,2,3,4,5]\xc2\xa0while [1,5,3]\xc2\xa0is not).\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums1 = [2,1,-2,5], nums2 = [3,0,-6]\nOutput: 18\nExplanation: Take subsequence [2,-2] from nums1 and subsequence [3,-6] from nums2.\nTheir dot product is (2*3 + (-2)*(-6)) = 18.\nExample 2:\nInput: nums1 = [3,-2], nums2 = [2,-6,7]\nOutput: 21\nExplanation: Take subsequence [3] from nums1 and subsequence [7] from nums2.\nTheir dot product is (3*7) = 21.\nExample 3:\nInput: nums1 = [-1,-1], nums2 = [1,1]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: Take subsequence [-1] from nums1 and subsequence [1] from nums2.\nTheir dot product is -1.\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 500\n-1000 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000\n\n'

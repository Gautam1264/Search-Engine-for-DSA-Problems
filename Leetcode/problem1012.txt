b'There are n people\xc2\xa0that are split into some unknown number of groups. Each person is labeled with a\xc2\xa0unique ID\xc2\xa0from\xc2\xa00\xc2\xa0to\xc2\xa0n - 1.\nYou are given an integer array\xc2\xa0groupSizes, where groupSizes[i]\xc2\xa0is the size of the group that person\xc2\xa0i\xc2\xa0is in. For example, if\xc2\xa0groupSizes[1] = 3, then\xc2\xa0person\xc2\xa01\xc2\xa0must be in a\xc2\xa0group of size\xc2\xa03.\nReturn\xc2\xa0a list of groups\xc2\xa0such that\xc2\xa0each person\xc2\xa0i\xc2\xa0is in a group of size\xc2\xa0groupSizes[i].\nEach person should\xc2\xa0appear in\xc2\xa0exactly one group,\xc2\xa0and every person must be in a group. If there are\xc2\xa0multiple answers, return any of them. It is guaranteed that there will be at least one valid solution for the given input.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: groupSizes = [3,3,3,3,3,1,3]\nOutput: [[5],[0,1,2],[3,4,6]]\nExplanation: \nThe first group is [5]. The size is 1, and groupSizes[5] = 1.\nThe second group is [0,1,2]. The size is 3, and groupSizes[0] = groupSizes[1] = groupSizes[2] = 3.\nThe third group is [3,4,6]. The size is 3, and groupSizes[3] = groupSizes[4] = groupSizes[6] = 3.\nOther possible solutions are [[2,1,6],[5],[0,4,3]] and [[5],[0,6,2],[4,3,1]].\n\nExample 2:\nInput: groupSizes = [2,1,3,3,3,2]\nOutput: [[1],[0,5],[2,3,4]]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\ngroupSizes.length == n\n1 <= n\xc2\xa0<= 500\n1 <=\xc2\xa0groupSizes[i] <= n\n\n'

b'You are given three positive integers:\xc2\xa0n, index, and maxSum. You want to construct an array nums (0-indexed) that satisfies the following conditions:\n\nnums.length == n\nnums[i] is a positive integer where 0 <= i < n.\nabs(nums[i] - nums[i+1]) <= 1 where 0 <= i < n-1.\nThe sum of all the elements of nums does not exceed maxSum.\nnums[index] is maximized.\n\nReturn nums[index] of the constructed array.\nNote that abs(x) equals x if x >= 0, and -x otherwise.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 4, index = 2,  maxSum = 6\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: nums = [1,2,2,1] is one array that satisfies all the conditions.\nThere are no arrays that satisfy all the conditions and have nums[2] == 3, so 2 is the maximum nums[2].\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 6, index = 1,  maxSum = 10\nOutput: 3\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= maxSum <= 109\n0 <= index < n\n\n'

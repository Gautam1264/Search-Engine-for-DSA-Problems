b'Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.\nIf there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and leave the other as original.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "abcdefg", k = 2\nOutput: "bacdfeg"\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "abcd", k = 2\nOutput: "bacd"\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 104\ns consists of only lowercase English letters.\n1 <= k <= 104\n\n'

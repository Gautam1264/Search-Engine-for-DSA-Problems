b'You are given an array of intervals, where intervals[i] = [starti, endi] and each starti is unique.\nThe right interval for an interval i is an interval j such that startj >= endi and startj is minimized. Note that i may equal j.\nReturn an array of right interval indices for each interval i. If no right interval exists for interval i, then put -1 at index i.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: intervals = [[1,2]]\nOutput: [-1]\nExplanation: There is only one interval in the collection, so it outputs -1.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: intervals = [[3,4],[2,3],[1,2]]\nOutput: [-1,0,1]\nExplanation: There is no right interval for [3,4].\nThe right interval for [2,3] is [3,4] since start0 = 3 is the smallest start that is >= end1 = 3.\nThe right interval for [1,2] is [2,3] since start1 = 2 is the smallest start that is >= end2 = 2.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: intervals = [[1,4],[2,3],[3,4]]\nOutput: [-1,2,-1]\nExplanation: There is no right interval for [1,4] and [3,4].\nThe right interval for [2,3] is [3,4] since start2 = 3 is the smallest start that is >= end1 = 3.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= intervals.length <= 2 * 104\nintervals[i].length == 2\n-106 <= starti <= endi <= 106\nThe start point of each interval is unique.\n\n'

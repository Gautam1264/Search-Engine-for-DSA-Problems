b"Given the root of an n-ary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.\nNary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal. Each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples)\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]\nOutput: [1,3,5,6,2,4]\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]\nOutput: [1,2,3,6,7,11,14,4,8,12,5,9,13,10]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].\n0 <= Node.val <= 104\nThe height of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to 1000.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nFollow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?\n"

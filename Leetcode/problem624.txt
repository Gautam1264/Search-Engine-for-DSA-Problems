b'There are n cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array flights where flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei] indicates that there is a flight from city fromi to city toi with cost pricei.\nYou are also given three integers src, dst, and k, return the cheapest price from src to dst with at most k stops. If there is no such route, return -1.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 4, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[2,0,100],[1,3,600],[2,3,200]], src = 0, dst = 3, k = 1\nOutput: 700\nExplanation:\nThe graph is shown above.\nThe optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 3 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 600 = 700.\nNote that the path through cities [0,1,2,3] is cheaper but is invalid because it uses 2 stops.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1\nOutput: 200\nExplanation:\nThe graph is shown above.\nThe optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 2 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 100 = 200.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 0\nOutput: 500\nExplanation:\nThe graph is shown above.\nThe optimal path with no stops from city 0 to 2 is marked in red and has cost 500.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 100\n0 <= flights.length <= (n * (n - 1) / 2)\nflights[i].length == 3\n0 <= fromi, toi < n\nfromi != toi\n1 <= pricei <= 104\nThere will not be any multiple flights between two cities.\n0 <= src, dst, k < n\nsrc != dst\n\n'

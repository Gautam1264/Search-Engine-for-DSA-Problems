b'Given a string word, return the sum of the number of vowels (\'a\', \'e\', \'i\', \'o\', and \'u\') in every substring of word.\nA substring is a contiguous (non-empty) sequence of characters within a string.\nNote: Due to the large constraints, the answer may not fit in a signed 32-bit integer. Please be careful during the calculations.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: word = "aba"\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: \nAll possible substrings are: "a", "ab", "aba", "b", "ba", and "a".\n- "b" has 0 vowels in it\n- "a", "ab", "ba", and "a" have 1 vowel each\n- "aba" has 2 vowels in it\nHence, the total sum of vowels = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6. \n\nExample 2:\nInput: word = "abc"\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: \nAll possible substrings are: "a", "ab", "abc", "b", "bc", and "c".\n- "a", "ab", and "abc" have 1 vowel each\n- "b", "bc", and "c" have 0 vowels each\nHence, the total sum of vowels = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: word = "ltcd"\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: There are no vowels in any substring of "ltcd".\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= word.length <= 105\nword consists of lowercase English letters.\n\n'

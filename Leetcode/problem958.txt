b"Given two integer arrays\xc2\xa0arr1 and arr2, return the minimum number of operations (possibly zero) needed\xc2\xa0to make arr1 strictly increasing.\nIn one operation, you can choose two indices\xc2\xa00 <=\xc2\xa0i < arr1.length\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa00 <= j < arr2.length\xc2\xa0and do the assignment\xc2\xa0arr1[i] = arr2[j].\nIf there is no way to make\xc2\xa0arr1\xc2\xa0strictly increasing,\xc2\xa0return\xc2\xa0-1.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: arr1 = [1,5,3,6,7], arr2 = [1,3,2,4]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: Replace 5 with 2, then arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 6, 7].\n\nExample 2:\nInput: arr1 = [1,5,3,6,7], arr2 = [4,3,1]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Replace 5 with 3 and then replace 3 with 4. arr1 = [1, 3, 4, 6, 7].\n\nExample 3:\nInput: arr1 = [1,5,3,6,7], arr2 = [1,6,3,3]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: You can't make arr1 strictly increasing.\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length <= 2000\n0 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 10^9\n\n\xc2\xa0"

b'Serialization is converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.\nDesign an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary search tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string, and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.\nThe encoded string should be as compact as possible.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: root = [2,1,3]\nOutput: [2,1,3]\nExample 2:\nInput: root = []\nOutput: []\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].\n0 <= Node.val <= 104\nThe input tree is guaranteed to be a binary search tree.\n\n'

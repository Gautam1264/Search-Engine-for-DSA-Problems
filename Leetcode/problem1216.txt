b'You are given a string s and an integer array indices of the same length. The string s will be shuffled such that the character at the ith position moves to indices[i] in the shuffled string.\nReturn the shuffled string.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = "codeleet", indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]\nOutput: "leetcode"\nExplanation: As shown, "codeleet" becomes "leetcode" after shuffling.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "abc", indices = [0,1,2]\nOutput: "abc"\nExplanation: After shuffling, each character remains in its position.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\ns.length == indices.length == n\n1 <= n <= 100\ns consists of only lowercase English letters.\n0 <= indices[i] < n\nAll values of indices are unique.\n\n'

b'Given the root of a binary tree, each node in the tree has a distinct value.\nAfter deleting all nodes with a value in to_delete, we are left with a forest (a disjoint union of trees).\nReturn the roots of the trees in the remaining forest. You may return the result in any order.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], to_delete = [3,5]\nOutput: [[1,2,null,4],[6],[7]]\n\nExample 2:\nInput: root = [1,2,4,null,3], to_delete = [3]\nOutput: [[1,2,4]]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the given tree is at most 1000.\nEach node has a distinct value between 1 and 1000.\nto_delete.length <= 1000\nto_delete contains distinct values between 1 and 1000.\n\n'

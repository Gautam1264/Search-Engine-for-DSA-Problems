b'There are n servers numbered from 0 to n - 1 connected by undirected server-to-server connections forming a network where connections[i] = [ai, bi] represents a connection between servers ai and bi. Any server can reach other servers directly or indirectly through the network.\nA critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some servers unable to reach some other server.\nReturn all critical connections in the network in any order.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[1,3]]\nOutput: [[1,3]]\nExplanation: [[3,1]] is also accepted.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 2, connections = [[0,1]]\nOutput: [[0,1]]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= n <= 105\nn - 1 <= connections.length <= 105\n0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1\nai != bi\nThere are no repeated connections.\n\n'

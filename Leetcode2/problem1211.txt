b'Given two non-negative integers low and high. Return the count of odd numbers between low and high\xc2\xa0(inclusive).\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: low = 3, high = 7\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].\nExample 2:\nInput: low = 8, high = 10\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are [9].\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n0 <= low <= high\xc2\xa0<= 10^9\n'

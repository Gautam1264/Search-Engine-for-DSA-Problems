b'Given a string s, find two disjoint palindromic subsequences of s such that the product of their lengths is maximized. The two subsequences are disjoint if they do not both pick a character at the same index.\nReturn the maximum possible product of the lengths of the two palindromic subsequences.\nA subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = "leetcodecom"\nOutput: 9\nExplanation: An optimal solution is to choose "ete" for the 1st subsequence and "cdc" for the 2nd subsequence.\nThe product of their lengths is: 3 * 3 = 9.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "bb"\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: An optimal solution is to choose "b" (the first character) for the 1st subsequence and "b" (the second character) for the 2nd subsequence.\nThe product of their lengths is: 1 * 1 = 1.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s = "accbcaxxcxx"\nOutput: 25\nExplanation: An optimal solution is to choose "accca" for the 1st subsequence and "xxcxx" for the 2nd subsequence.\nThe product of their lengths is: 5 * 5 = 25.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= s.length <= 12\ns consists of lowercase English letters only.\n\n'

b"Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.\nInitially, there is a number n on the chalkboard. On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:\n\nChoosing any x with 0 < x < n and n % x == 0.\nReplacing the number n on the chalkboard with n - x.\n\nAlso, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.\nReturn true if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 2\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Alice chooses 1, and Bob has no more moves.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 3\nOutput: false\nExplanation: Alice chooses 1, Bob chooses 1, and Alice has no more moves.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 1000\n\n"

b'An array is squareful if the sum of every pair of adjacent elements is a perfect square.\nGiven an integer array nums, return the number of permutations of nums that are squareful.\nTwo permutations perm1 and perm2 are different if there is some index i such that perm1[i] != perm2[i].\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [1,17,8]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: [1,8,17] and [17,8,1] are the valid permutations.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [2,2,2]\nOutput: 1\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 12\n0 <= nums[i] <= 109\n\n'

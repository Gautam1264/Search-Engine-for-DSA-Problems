b"Alice and Bob continue their\xc2\xa0games with piles of stones.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of\xc2\xa0piles\xc2\xa0arranged in a row, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones\xc2\xa0piles[i].\xc2\xa0 The objective of the game is to end with the most\xc2\xa0stones.\xc2\xa0\nAlice\xc2\xa0and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first.\xc2\xa0 Initially, M = 1.\nOn each player's turn, that player\xc2\xa0can take all the stones in the first X remaining piles, where 1 <= X <= 2M.\xc2\xa0 Then, we set\xc2\xa0M = max(M, X).\nThe game continues until all the stones have been taken.\nAssuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return the maximum number of stones Alice\xc2\xa0can get.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: piles = [2,7,9,4,4]\nOutput: 10\nExplanation:  If Alice takes one pile at the beginning, Bob takes two piles, then Alice takes 2 piles again. Alice can get 2 + 4 + 4 = 10 piles in total. If Alice takes two piles at the beginning, then Bob can take all three piles left. In this case, Alice get 2 + 7 = 9 piles in total. So we return 10 since it's larger. \n\nExample 2:\nInput: piles = [1,2,3,4,5,100]\nOutput: 104\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= piles.length <= 100\n1 <= piles[i]\xc2\xa0<= 104\n\n"

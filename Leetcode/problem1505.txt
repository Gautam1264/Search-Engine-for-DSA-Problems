b'A triplet is an array of three integers. You are given a 2D integer array triplets, where triplets[i] = [ai, bi, ci] describes the ith triplet. You are also given an integer array target = [x, y, z] that describes the triplet you want to obtain.\nTo obtain target, you may apply the following operation on triplets any number of times (possibly zero):\n\nChoose two indices (0-indexed) i and j (i != j) and update triplets[j] to become [max(ai, aj), max(bi, bj), max(ci, cj)].\n\n\t\nFor example, if triplets[i] = [2, 5, 3] and triplets[j] = [1, 7, 5], triplets[j] will be updated to [max(2, 1), max(5, 7), max(3, 5)] = [2, 7, 5].\n\n\n\nReturn true if it is possible to obtain the target triplet [x, y, z] as an element of triplets, or false otherwise.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: triplets = [[2,5,3],[1,8,4],[1,7,5]], target = [2,7,5]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Perform the following operations:\n- Choose the first and last triplets [[2,5,3],[1,8,4],[1,7,5]]. Update the last triplet to be [max(2,1), max(5,7), max(3,5)] = [2,7,5]. triplets = [[2,5,3],[1,8,4],[2,7,5]]\nThe target triplet [2,7,5] is now an element of triplets.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: triplets = [[3,4,5],[4,5,6]], target = [3,2,5]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: It is impossible to have [3,2,5] as an element because there is no 2 in any of the triplets.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: triplets = [[2,5,3],[2,3,4],[1,2,5],[5,2,3]], target = [5,5,5]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Perform the following operations:\n- Choose the first and third triplets [[2,5,3],[2,3,4],[1,2,5],[5,2,3]]. Update the third triplet to be [max(2,1), max(5,2), max(3,5)] = [2,5,5]. triplets = [[2,5,3],[2,3,4],[2,5,5],[5,2,3]].\n- Choose the third and fourth triplets [[2,5,3],[2,3,4],[2,5,5],[5,2,3]]. Update the fourth triplet to be [max(2,5), max(5,2), max(5,3)] = [5,5,5]. triplets = [[2,5,3],[2,3,4],[2,5,5],[5,5,5]].\nThe target triplet [5,5,5] is now an element of triplets.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= triplets.length <= 105\ntriplets[i].length == target.length == 3\n1 <= ai, bi, ci, x, y, z <= 1000\n\n'

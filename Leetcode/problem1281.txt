b'Given an integer n, you must transform it into 0 using the following operations any number of times:\n\nChange the rightmost (0th) bit in the binary representation of n.\nChange the ith bit in the binary representation of n if the (i-1)th bit is set to 1 and the (i-2)th through 0th bits are set to 0.\n\nReturn the minimum number of operations to transform n into 0.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 3\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The binary representation of 3 is "11".\n"11" -> "01" with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.\n"01" -> "00" with the 1st operation.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 6\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: The binary representation of 6 is "110".\n"110" -> "010" with the 2nd operation since the 1st bit is 1 and 0th through 0th bits are 0.\n"010" -> "011" with the 1st operation.\n"011" -> "001" with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.\n"001" -> "000" with the 1st operation.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n0 <= n <= 109\n\n'

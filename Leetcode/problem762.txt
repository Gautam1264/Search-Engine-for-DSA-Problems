b'A binary string is monotone increasing if it consists of some number of 0\'s (possibly none), followed by some number of 1\'s (also possibly none).\nYou are given a binary string s. You can flip s[i] changing it from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.\nReturn the minimum number of flips to make s monotone increasing.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "00110"\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: We flip the last digit to get 00111.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "010110"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: We flip to get 011111, or alternatively 000111.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s = "00011000"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: We flip to get 00000000.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 105\ns[i] is either \'0\' or \'1\'.\n\n'

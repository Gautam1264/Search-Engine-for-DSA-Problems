b'You are given a string s consisting only of characters \'a\' and \'b\'\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b.\nYou can delete any number of characters in s to make s balanced. s is balanced if there is no pair of indices (i,j) such that i < j and s[i] = \'b\' and s[j]= \'a\'.\nReturn the minimum number of deletions needed to make s balanced.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "aababbab"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: You can either:\nDelete the characters at 0-indexed positions 2 and 6 ("aababbab" -> "aaabbb"), or\nDelete the characters at 0-indexed positions 3 and 6 ("aababbab" -> "aabbbb").\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "bbaaaaabb"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The only solution is to delete the first two characters.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 105\ns[i] is\xc2\xa0\'a\' or \'b\'\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\n'

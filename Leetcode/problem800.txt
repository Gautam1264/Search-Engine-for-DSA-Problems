b'Given a single positive integer x, we will write an expression of the form x (op1) x (op2) x (op3) x ... where each operator op1, op2, etc. is either addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division (+, -, *, or /). For example, with x = 3, we might write 3 * 3 / 3 + 3 - 3 which is a value of 3.\nWhen writing such an expression, we adhere to the following conventions:\n\nThe division operator (/) returns rational numbers.\nThere are no parentheses placed anywhere.\nWe use the usual order of operations: multiplication and division happen before addition and subtraction.\nIt is not allowed to use the unary negation operator (-). For example, "x - x" is a valid expression as it only uses subtraction, but "-x + x" is not because it uses negation.\n\nWe would like to write an expression with the least number of operators such that the expression equals the given target. Return the least number of operators used.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: x = 3, target = 19\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: 3 * 3 + 3 * 3 + 3 / 3.\nThe expression contains 5 operations.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: x = 5, target = 501\nOutput: 8\nExplanation: 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 - 5 * 5 * 5 + 5 / 5.\nThe expression contains 8 operations.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: x = 100, target = 100000000\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: 100 * 100 * 100 * 100.\nThe expression contains 3 operations.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= x <= 100\n1 <= target <= 2 * 108\n\n'

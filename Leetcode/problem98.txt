b"Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).\nA valid BST is defined as follows:\n\nThe left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.\nThe right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.\nBoth the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [2,1,3]\nOutput: true\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].\n-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1\n\n"

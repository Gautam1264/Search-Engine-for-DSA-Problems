b'A company is planning to interview 2n people. Given the array costs where costs[i] = [aCosti, bCosti],\xc2\xa0the cost of flying the ith person to city a is aCosti, and the cost of flying the ith person to city b is bCosti.\nReturn the minimum cost to fly every person to a city such that exactly n people arrive in each city.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: costs = [[10,20],[30,200],[400,50],[30,20]]\nOutput: 110\nExplanation: \nThe first person goes to city A for a cost of 10.\nThe second person goes to city A for a cost of 30.\nThe third person goes to city B for a cost of 50.\nThe fourth person goes to city B for a cost of 20.\n\nThe total minimum cost is 10 + 30 + 50 + 20 = 110 to have half the people interviewing in each city.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: costs = [[259,770],[448,54],[926,667],[184,139],[840,118],[577,469]]\nOutput: 1859\n\nExample 3:\nInput: costs = [[515,563],[451,713],[537,709],[343,819],[855,779],[457,60],[650,359],[631,42]]\nOutput: 3086\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n2 * n == costs.length\n2 <= costs.length <= 100\ncosts.length is even.\n1 <= aCosti, bCosti <= 1000\n\n'

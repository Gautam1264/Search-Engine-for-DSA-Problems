b'Given an array intervals where intervals[i] = [li, ri] represent the interval [li, ri), remove all intervals that are covered by another interval in the list.\nThe interval [a, b) is covered by the interval [c, d) if and only if c <= a and b <= d.\nReturn the number of remaining intervals.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: intervals = [[1,4],[3,6],[2,8]]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Interval [3,6] is covered by [2,8], therefore it is removed.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: intervals = [[1,4],[2,3]]\nOutput: 1\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= intervals.length <= 1000\nintervals[i].length == 2\n0 <= li < ri <= 105\nAll the given intervals are unique.\n\n'

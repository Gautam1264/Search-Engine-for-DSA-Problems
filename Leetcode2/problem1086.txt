b'Given an m x n grid. Each cell of the grid has a sign pointing to the next cell you should visit if you are currently in this cell. The sign of grid[i][j] can be:\n\n1 which means go to the cell to the right. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i][j + 1])\n2 which means go to the cell to the left. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i][j - 1])\n3 which means go to the lower cell. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i + 1][j])\n4 which means go to the upper cell. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i - 1][j])\n\nNotice that there could be some signs on the cells of the grid that point outside the grid.\nYou will initially start at the upper left cell (0, 0). A valid path in the grid is a path that starts from the upper left cell (0, 0) and ends at the bottom-right cell (m - 1, n - 1) following the signs on the grid. The valid path does not have to be the shortest.\nYou can modify the sign on a cell with cost = 1. You can modify the sign on a cell one time only.\nReturn the minimum cost to make the grid have at least one valid path.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: grid = [[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2,2],[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2,2]]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: You will start at point (0, 0).\nThe path to (3, 3) is as follows. (0, 0) --> (0, 1) --> (0, 2) --> (0, 3) change the arrow to down with cost = 1 --> (1, 3) --> (1, 2) --> (1, 1) --> (1, 0) change the arrow to down with cost = 1 --> (2, 0) --> (2, 1) --> (2, 2) --> (2, 3) change the arrow to down with cost = 1 --> (3, 3)\nThe total cost = 3.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: grid = [[1,1,3],[3,2,2],[1,1,4]]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: You can follow the path from (0, 0) to (2, 2).\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: grid = [[1,2],[4,3]]\nOutput: 1\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nm == grid.length\nn == grid[i].length\n1 <= m, n <= 100\n1 <= grid[i][j] <= 4\n\n'

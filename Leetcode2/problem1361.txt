b'You are given a string s and two integers x and y. You can perform two types of operations any number of times.\n\nRemove substring "ab" and gain x points.\n\n\t\nFor example, when removing "ab" from "cabxbae" it becomes "cxbae".\n\n\nRemove substring "ba" and gain y points.\n\t\nFor example, when removing "ba" from "cabxbae" it becomes "cabxe".\n\n\n\nReturn the maximum points you can gain after applying the above operations on s.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "cdbcbbaaabab", x = 4, y = 5\nOutput: 19\nExplanation:\n- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcbbaaabab". Now, s = "cdbcbbaaab" and 5 points are added to the score.\n- Remove the "ab" underlined in "cdbcbbaaab". Now, s = "cdbcbbaa" and 4 points are added to the score.\n- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcbbaa". Now, s = "cdbcba" and 5 points are added to the score.\n- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcba". Now, s = "cdbc" and 5 points are added to the score.\nTotal score = 5 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 19.\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "aabbaaxybbaabb", x = 5, y = 4\nOutput: 20\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 105\n1 <= x, y <= 104\ns consists of lowercase English letters.\n\n'

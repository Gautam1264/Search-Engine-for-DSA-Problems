b'A complex number can be represented as a string on the form "real+imaginaryi" where:\n\nreal is the real part and is an integer in the range [-100, 100].\nimaginary is the imaginary part and is an integer in the range [-100, 100].\ni2 == -1.\n\nGiven two complex numbers num1 and num2 as strings, return a string of the complex number that represents their multiplications.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: num1 = "1+1i", num2 = "1+1i"\nOutput: "0+2i"\nExplanation: (1 + i) * (1 + i) = 1 + i2 + 2 * i = 2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+2i.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: num1 = "1+-1i", num2 = "1+-1i"\nOutput: "0+-2i"\nExplanation: (1 - i) * (1 - i) = 1 + i2 - 2 * i = -2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+-2i.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nnum1 and num2 are valid complex numbers.\n\n'

b'You are given an integer array digits, where each element is a digit. The array may contain duplicates.\nYou need to find all the unique integers that follow the given requirements:\n\nThe integer consists of the concatenation of three elements from digits in any arbitrary order.\nThe integer does not have leading zeros.\nThe integer is even.\n\nFor example, if the given digits were [1, 2, 3], integers 132 and 312 follow the requirements.\nReturn a sorted array of the unique integers.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: digits = [2,1,3,0]\nOutput: [102,120,130,132,210,230,302,310,312,320]\nExplanation: All the possible integers that follow the requirements are in the output array. \nNotice that there are no odd integers or integers with leading zeros.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: digits = [2,2,8,8,2]\nOutput: [222,228,282,288,822,828,882]\nExplanation: The same digit can be used as many times as it appears in digits. \nIn this example, the digit 8 is used twice each time in 288, 828, and 882. \n\nExample 3:\nInput: digits = [3,7,5]\nOutput: []\nExplanation: No even integers can be formed using the given digits.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n3 <= digits.length <= 100\n0 <= digits[i] <= 9\n\n'

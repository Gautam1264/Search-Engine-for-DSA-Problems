b'Given 2 integers n and start. Your task is return any permutation p\xc2\xa0of (0,1,2.....,2^n -1) such that :\n\np[0] = start\np[i] and p[i+1]\xc2\xa0differ by only one bit in their binary representation.\np[0] and p[2^n -1]\xc2\xa0must also differ by only one bit in their binary representation.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 2, start = 3\nOutput: [3,2,0,1]\nExplanation: The binary representation of the permutation is (11,10,00,01). \nAll the adjacent element differ by one bit. Another valid permutation is [3,1,0,2]\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 3, start = 2\nOutput: [2,6,7,5,4,0,1,3]\nExplanation: The binary representation of the permutation is (010,110,111,101,100,000,001,011).\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 16\n0 <= start\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa02 ^ n\n'

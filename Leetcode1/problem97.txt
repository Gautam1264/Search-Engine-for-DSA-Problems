b'Given strings s1, s2, and s3, find whether s3 is formed by an interleaving of s1 and s2.\nAn interleaving of two strings s and t is a configuration where they are divided into non-empty substrings such that:\n\ns = s1 + s2 + ... + sn\nt = t1 + t2 + ... + tm\n|n - m| <= 1\nThe interleaving is s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ... or t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...\n\nNote: a + b is the concatenation of strings a and b.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbcbcac"\nOutput: true\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbbaccc"\nOutput: false\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s1 = "", s2 = "", s3 = ""\nOutput: true\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n0 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100\n0 <= s3.length <= 200\ns1, s2, and s3 consist of lowercase English letters.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nFollow up: Could you solve it using only O(s2.length) additional memory space?\n'

b'Given two integers n and k, construct a list answer that contains n different positive integers ranging from 1 to n and obeys the following requirement:\n\nSuppose this list is answer =\xc2\xa0[a1, a2, a3, ... , an], then the list [|a1 - a2|, |a2 - a3|, |a3 - a4|, ... , |an-1 - an|] has exactly k distinct integers.\n\nReturn the list answer. If there multiple valid answers, return any of them.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 3, k = 1\nOutput: [1,2,3]\nExplanation: The [1,2,3] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [1,1] has exactly 1 distinct integer: 1\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 3, k = 2\nOutput: [1,3,2]\nExplanation: The [1,3,2] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [2,1] has exactly 2 distinct integers: 1 and 2.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= k < n <= 104\n\n'

b'There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of n + 1 points at different altitudes. The biker starts his trip on point 0 with altitude equal 0.\nYou are given an integer array gain of length n where gain[i] is the net gain in altitude between points i\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b and i + 1 for all (0 <= i < n). Return the highest altitude of a point.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: gain = [-5,1,5,0,-7]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: The altitudes are [0,-5,-4,1,1,-6]. The highest is 1.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: gain = [-4,-3,-2,-1,4,3,2]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: The altitudes are [0,-4,-7,-9,-10,-6,-3,-1]. The highest is 0.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nn == gain.length\n1 <= n <= 100\n-100 <= gain[i] <= 100\n\n'

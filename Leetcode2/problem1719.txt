b'Given an integer num, return three consecutive integers (as a sorted array) that sum to num. If num cannot be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers, return an empty array.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: num = 33\nOutput: [10,11,12]\nExplanation: 33 can be expressed as 10 + 11 + 12 = 33.\n10, 11, 12 are 3 consecutive integers, so we return [10, 11, 12].\n\nExample 2:\nInput: num = 4\nOutput: []\nExplanation: There is no way to express 4 as the sum of 3 consecutive integers.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n0 <= num <= 1015\n\n'

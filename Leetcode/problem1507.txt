b'A peak element in a 2D grid is an element that is strictly greater than all of its adjacent neighbors to the left, right, top, and bottom.\nGiven a 0-indexed m x n matrix mat where no two adjacent cells are equal, find any peak element mat[i][j] and return the length 2 array [i,j].\nYou may assume that the entire matrix is surrounded by an outer perimeter with the value -1 in each cell.\nYou must write an algorithm that runs in O(m log(n)) or O(n log(m)) time.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: mat = [[1,4],[3,2]]\nOutput: [0,1]\nExplanation:\xc2\xa0Both 3 and 4 are peak elements so [1,0] and [0,1] are both acceptable answers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: mat = [[10,20,15],[21,30,14],[7,16,32]]\nOutput: [1,1]\nExplanation:\xc2\xa0Both 30 and 32 are peak elements so [1,1] and [2,2] are both acceptable answers.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nm == mat.length\nn == mat[i].length\n1 <= m, n <= 500\n1 <= mat[i][j] <= 105\nNo two adjacent cells are equal.\n\n'

b'There is an integer array perm that is a permutation of the first n positive integers, where n is always odd.\nIt was encoded into another integer array encoded of length n - 1, such that encoded[i] = perm[i] XOR perm[i + 1]. For example, if perm = [1,3,2], then encoded = [2,1].\nGiven the encoded array, return the original array perm. It is guaranteed that the answer exists and is unique.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: encoded = [3,1]\nOutput: [1,2,3]\nExplanation: If perm = [1,2,3], then encoded = [1 XOR 2,2 XOR 3] = [3,1]\n\nExample 2:\nInput: encoded = [6,5,4,6]\nOutput: [2,4,1,5,3]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n3 <= n <\xc2\xa0105\nn\xc2\xa0is odd.\nencoded.length == n - 1\n\n'

b"Given an array of integers nums, find the maximum length of a subarray where the product of all its elements is positive.\nA subarray of an array is a consecutive sequence of zero or more values taken out of that array.\nReturn the maximum length of a subarray with positive product.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [1,-2,-3,4]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: The array nums already has a positive product of 24.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [0,1,-2,-3,-4]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The longest subarray with positive product is [1,-2,-3] which has a product of 6.\nNotice that we cannot include 0 in the subarray since that'll make the product 0 which is not positive.\nExample 3:\nInput: nums = [-1,-2,-3,0,1]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The longest subarray with positive product is [-1,-2] or [-2,-3].\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 105\n-109 <= nums[i] <= 109\n\n"

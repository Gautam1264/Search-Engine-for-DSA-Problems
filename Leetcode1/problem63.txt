b'You are given an m x n integer array grid. There is a robot initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m-1][n-1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.\nAn obstacle and space are marked as 1 or 0 respectively in grid. A path that the robot takes cannot include any square that is an obstacle.\nReturn the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.\nThe testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.\nThere are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:\n1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down\n2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]\nOutput: 1\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nm == obstacleGrid.length\nn == obstacleGrid[i].length\n1 <= m, n <= 100\nobstacleGrid[i][j] is 0 or 1.\n\n'

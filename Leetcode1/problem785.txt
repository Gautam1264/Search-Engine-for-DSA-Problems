b'Given an array arr of 4 digits, find the latest 24-hour time that can be made using each digit exactly once.\n24-hour times are formatted as "HH:MM", where HH is between 00 and 23, and MM is between 00 and 59. The earliest 24-hour time is 00:00, and the latest is 23:59.\nReturn the latest 24-hour time in "HH:MM" format. If no valid time can be made, return an empty string.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: arr = [1,2,3,4]\nOutput: "23:41"\nExplanation: The valid 24-hour times are "12:34", "12:43", "13:24", "13:42", "14:23", "14:32", "21:34", "21:43", "23:14", and "23:41". Of these times, "23:41" is the latest.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: arr = [5,5,5,5]\nOutput: ""\nExplanation: There are no valid 24-hour times as "55:55" is not valid.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\narr.length == 4\n0 <= arr[i] <= 9\n\n'

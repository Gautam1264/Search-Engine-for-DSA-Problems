b'You are given the root of a binary tree where each node has a value in the range [0, 25] representing the letters \'a\' to \'z\'.\nReturn the lexicographically smallest string that starts at a leaf of this tree and ends at the root.\nAs a reminder, any shorter prefix of a string is lexicographically smaller.\n\nFor example, "ab" is lexicographically smaller than "aba".\n\nA leaf of a node is a node that has no children.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [0,1,2,3,4,3,4]\nOutput: "dba"\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [25,1,3,1,3,0,2]\nOutput: "adz"\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: root = [2,2,1,null,1,0,null,0]\nOutput: "abc"\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 8500].\n0 <= Node.val <= 25\n\n'

b'You are given a 2D integer grid of size m x n and an integer x. In one operation, you can add x to or subtract x from any element in the grid.\nA uni-value grid is a grid where all the elements of it are equal.\nReturn the minimum number of operations to make the grid uni-value. If it is not possible, return -1.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: grid = [[2,4],[6,8]], x = 2\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: We can make every element equal to 4 by doing the following: \n- Add x to 2 once.\n- Subtract x from 6 once.\n- Subtract x from 8 twice.\nA total of 4 operations were used.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: grid = [[1,5],[2,3]], x = 1\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: We can make every element equal to 3.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: grid = [[1,2],[3,4]], x = 2\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: It is impossible to make every element equal.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nm == grid.length\nn == grid[i].length\n1 <= m, n <= 105\n1 <= m * n <= 105\n1 <= x, grid[i][j] <= 104\n\n'

b'On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at (0, 0) and faces north. Note that:\n\nThe north direction is the positive direction of the y-axis.\nThe south direction is the negative direction of the y-axis.\nThe east direction is the positive direction of the x-axis.\nThe west direction is the negative direction of the x-axis.\n\nThe robot can receive one of three instructions:\n\n"G": go straight 1 unit.\n"L": turn 90 degrees to the left (i.e., anti-clockwise direction).\n"R": turn 90 degrees to the right (i.e., clockwise direction).\n\nThe robot performs the instructions given in order, and repeats them forever.\nReturn true if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: instructions = "GGLLGG"\nOutput: true\nExplanation: The robot is initially at (0, 0) facing the north direction.\n"G": move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: North.\n"G": move one step. Position: (0, 2). Direction: North.\n"L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 2). Direction: West.\n"L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 2). Direction: South.\n"G": move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: South.\n"G": move one step. Position: (0, 0). Direction: South.\nRepeating the instructions, the robot goes into the cycle: (0, 0) --> (0, 1) --> (0, 2) --> (0, 1) --> (0, 0).\nBased on that, we return true.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: instructions = "GG"\nOutput: false\nExplanation: The robot is initially at (0, 0) facing the north direction.\n"G": move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: North.\n"G": move one step. Position: (0, 2). Direction: North.\nRepeating the instructions, keeps advancing in the north direction and does not go into cycles.\nBased on that, we return false.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: instructions = "GL"\nOutput: true\nExplanation: The robot is initially at (0, 0) facing the north direction.\n"G": move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: North.\n"L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 1). Direction: West.\n"G": move one step. Position: (-1, 1). Direction: West.\n"L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (-1, 1). Direction: South.\n"G": move one step. Position: (-1, 0). Direction: South.\n"L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (-1, 0). Direction: East.\n"G": move one step. Position: (0, 0). Direction: East.\n"L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 0). Direction: North.\nRepeating the instructions, the robot goes into the cycle: (0, 0) --> (0, 1) --> (-1, 1) --> (-1, 0) --> (0, 0).\nBased on that, we return true.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= instructions.length <= 100\ninstructions[i] is \'G\', \'L\' or, \'R\'.\n\n'

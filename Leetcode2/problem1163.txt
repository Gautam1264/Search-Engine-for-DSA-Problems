b'Given a binary string s and an integer k, return true if every binary code of length k is a substring of s. Otherwise, return false.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "00110110", k = 2\nOutput: true\nExplanation: The binary codes of length 2 are "00", "01", "10" and "11". They can be all found as substrings at indices 0, 1, 3 and 2 respectively.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "0110", k = 1\nOutput: true\nExplanation: The binary codes of length 1 are "0" and "1", it is clear that both exist as a substring. \n\nExample 3:\nInput: s = "0110", k = 2\nOutput: false\nExplanation: The binary code "00" is of length 2 and does not exist in the array.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 5 * 105\ns[i] is either \'0\' or \'1\'.\n1 <= k <= 20\n\n'

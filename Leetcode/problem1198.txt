b'You are given a string num representing the digits of a very large integer and an integer k. You are allowed to swap any two adjacent digits of the integer at most k times.\nReturn the minimum integer you can obtain also as a string.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: num = "4321", k = 4\nOutput: "1342"\nExplanation: The steps to obtain the minimum integer from 4321 with 4 adjacent swaps are shown.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: num = "100", k = 1\nOutput: "010"\nExplanation: It\'s ok for the output to have leading zeros, but the input is guaranteed not to have any leading zeros.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: num = "36789", k = 1000\nOutput: "36789"\nExplanation: We can keep the number without any swaps.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= num.length <= 3 * 104\nnum consists of only digits and does not contain leading zeros.\n1 <= k <= 104\n\n'

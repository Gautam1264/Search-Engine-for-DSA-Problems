b'You are given a string s of lowercase English letters and an integer array shifts of the same length.\nCall the shift() of a letter, the next letter in the alphabet, (wrapping around so that \'z\' becomes \'a\').\n\nFor example, shift(\'a\') = \'b\', shift(\'t\') = \'u\', and shift(\'z\') = \'a\'.\n\nNow for each shifts[i] = x, we want to shift the first i + 1 letters of s, x times.\nReturn the final string after all such shifts to s are applied.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "abc", shifts = [3,5,9]\nOutput: "rpl"\nExplanation: We start with "abc".\nAfter shifting the first 1 letters of s by 3, we have "dbc".\nAfter shifting the first 2 letters of s by 5, we have "igc".\nAfter shifting the first 3 letters of s by 9, we have "rpl", the answer.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "aaa", shifts = [1,2,3]\nOutput: "gfd"\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 105\ns consists of lowercase English letters.\nshifts.length == s.length\n0 <= shifts[i] <= 109\n\n'

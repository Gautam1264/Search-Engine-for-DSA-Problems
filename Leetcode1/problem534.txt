b"You are asked to cut off all the trees in a forest for a golf event. The forest is represented as an m x n matrix. In this matrix:\n\n0 means the cell cannot be walked through.\n1 represents an empty cell that can be walked through.\nA number greater than 1 represents a tree in a cell that can be walked through, and this number is the tree's height.\n\nIn one step, you can walk in any of the four directions: north, east, south, and west. If you are standing in a cell with a tree, you can choose whether to cut it off.\nYou must cut off the trees in order from shortest to tallest. When you cut off a tree, the value at its cell becomes 1 (an empty cell).\nStarting from the point (0, 0), return the minimum steps you need to walk to cut off all the trees. If you cannot cut off all the trees, return -1.\nYou are guaranteed that no two trees have the same height, and there is at least one tree needs to be cut off.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: forest = [[1,2,3],[0,0,4],[7,6,5]]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: Following the path above allows you to cut off the trees from shortest to tallest in 6 steps.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: forest = [[1,2,3],[0,0,0],[7,6,5]]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: The trees in the bottom row cannot be accessed as the middle row is blocked.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: forest = [[2,3,4],[0,0,5],[8,7,6]]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: You can follow the same path as Example 1 to cut off all the trees.\nNote that you can cut off the first tree at (0, 0) before making any steps.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nm == forest.length\nn == forest[i].length\n1 <= m, n <= 50\n0 <= forest[i][j] <= 109\n\n"

b'Return the number of permutations of 1 to n so that prime numbers are at prime indices (1-indexed.)\n(Recall that an integer\xc2\xa0is prime if and only if it is greater than 1, and cannot be written as a product of two positive integers\xc2\xa0both smaller than it.)\nSince the answer may be large, return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 5\nOutput: 12\nExplanation: For example [1,2,5,4,3] is a valid permutation, but [5,2,3,4,1] is not because the prime number 5 is at index 1.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 100\nOutput: 682289015\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 100\n\n'

b'Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.\nA word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.\nReturn a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.\nNote that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "the sky is blue"\nOutput: "blue is sky the"\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "  hello world  "\nOutput: "world hello"\nExplanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s = "a good   example"\nOutput: "example good a"\nExplanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 104\ns contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces \' \'.\nThere is at least one word in s.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nFollow-up:\xc2\xa0If the string data type is mutable in your language, can\xc2\xa0you solve it\xc2\xa0in-place\xc2\xa0with\xc2\xa0O(1)\xc2\xa0extra space?\n'

b'Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.\nA happy number is a number defined by the following process:\n\nStarting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.\nRepeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.\nThose numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.\n\nReturn true if n is a happy number, and false if not.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 19\nOutput: true\nExplanation:\n12 + 92 = 82\n82 + 22 = 68\n62 + 82 = 100\n12 + 02 + 02 = 1\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 2\nOutput: false\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 231 - 1\n\n'

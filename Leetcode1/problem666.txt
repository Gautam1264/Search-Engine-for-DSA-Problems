b'In a string s\xc2\xa0of lowercase letters, these letters form consecutive groups of the same character.\nFor example, a string like s = "abbxxxxzyy" has the groups "a", "bb", "xxxx", "z", and\xc2\xa0"yy".\nA group is identified by an interval\xc2\xa0[start, end], where\xc2\xa0start\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0end\xc2\xa0denote the start and end\xc2\xa0indices (inclusive) of the group. In the above example,\xc2\xa0"xxxx"\xc2\xa0has the interval\xc2\xa0[3,6].\nA group is considered\xc2\xa0large\xc2\xa0if it has 3 or more characters.\nReturn\xc2\xa0the intervals of every large group sorted in\xc2\xa0increasing order by start index.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "abbxxxxzzy"\nOutput: [[3,6]]\nExplanation: "xxxx" is the only large group with start index 3 and end index 6.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "abc"\nOutput: []\nExplanation: We have groups "a", "b", and "c", none of which are large groups.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s = "abcdddeeeeaabbbcd"\nOutput: [[3,5],[6,9],[12,14]]\nExplanation: The large groups are "ddd", "eeee", and "bbb".\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 1000\ns contains lowercase English letters only.\n\n'

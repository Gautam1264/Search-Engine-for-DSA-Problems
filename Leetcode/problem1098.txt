b'Given the root of a binary search tree, return a balanced binary search tree with the same node values. If there is more than one answer, return any of them.\nA binary search tree is balanced if the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than 1.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,null]\nOutput: [2,1,3,null,null,null,4]\nExplanation: This is not the only correct answer, [3,1,4,null,2] is also correct.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [2,1,3]\nOutput: [2,1,3]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].\n1 <= Node.val <= 105\n\n'

b'You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from 0 to 9 only.\nEach root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.\n\nFor example, the root-to-leaf path 1 -> 2 -> 3 represents the number 123.\n\nReturn the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.\nA leaf node is a node with no children.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [1,2,3]\nOutput: 25\nExplanation:\nThe root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.\nThe root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.\nTherefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [4,9,0,5,1]\nOutput: 1026\nExplanation:\nThe root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.\nThe root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.\nThe root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.\nTherefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].\n0 <= Node.val <= 9\nThe depth of the tree will not exceed 10.\n\n'

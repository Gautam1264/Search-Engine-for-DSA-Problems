b'You are given two string arrays words1 and words2.\nA string b is a subset of string a if every letter in b occurs in a including multiplicity.\n\nFor example, "wrr" is a subset of "warrior" but is not a subset of "world".\n\nA string a from words1 is universal if for every string b in words2, b is a subset of a.\nReturn an array of all the universal strings in words1. You may return the answer in any order.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: words1 = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], words2 = ["e","o"]\nOutput: ["facebook","google","leetcode"]\n\nExample 2:\nInput: words1 = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], words2 = ["l","e"]\nOutput: ["apple","google","leetcode"]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= words1.length, words2.length <= 104\n1 <= words1[i].length, words2[i].length <= 10\nwords1[i] and words2[i] consist only of lowercase English letters.\nAll the strings of words1 are unique.\n\n'

b'You are given a string word that consists of digits and lowercase English letters.\nYou will replace every non-digit character with a space. For example, "a123bc34d8ef34" will become " 123\xc2\xa0 34 8\xc2\xa0 34". Notice that you are left with some integers that are separated by at least one space: "123", "34", "8", and "34".\nReturn the number of different integers after performing the replacement operations on word.\nTwo integers are considered different if their decimal representations without any leading zeros are different.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: word = "a123bc34d8ef34"\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The three different integers are "123", "34", and "8". Notice that "34" is only counted once.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: word = "leet1234code234"\nOutput: 2\n\nExample 3:\nInput: word = "a1b01c001"\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: The three integers "1", "01", and "001" all represent the same integer because\nthe leading zeros are ignored when comparing their decimal values.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= word.length <= 1000\nword consists of digits and lowercase English letters.\n\n'

b'A sentence is a list of tokens separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Every token is either a positive number consisting of digits 0-9 with no leading zeros, or a word consisting of lowercase English letters.\n\nFor example, "a puppy has 2 eyes 4 legs" is a sentence with seven tokens: "2" and "4" are numbers and the other tokens such as "puppy" are words.\n\nGiven a string s representing a sentence, you need to check if all the numbers in s are strictly increasing from left to right (i.e., other than the last number, each number is strictly smaller than the number on its right in s).\nReturn true if so, or false otherwise.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = "1 box has 3 blue 4 red 6 green and 12 yellow marbles"\nOutput: true\nExplanation: The numbers in s are: 1, 3, 4, 6, 12.\nThey are strictly increasing from left to right: 1 < 3 < 4 < 6 < 12.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "hello world 5 x 5"\nOutput: false\nExplanation: The numbers in s are: 5, 5. They are not strictly increasing.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = "sunset is at 7 51 pm overnight lows will be in the low 50 and 60 s"\nOutput: false\nExplanation: The numbers in s are: 7, 51, 50, 60. They are not strictly increasing.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n3 <= s.length <= 200\ns consists of lowercase English letters, spaces, and digits from 0 to 9, inclusive.\nThe number of tokens in s is between 2 and 100, inclusive.\nThe tokens in s are separated by a single space.\nThere are at least two numbers in s.\nEach number in s is a positive number less than 100, with no leading zeros.\ns contains no leading or trailing spaces.\n\n'

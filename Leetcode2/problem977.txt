b'Balanced strings are those that have an equal quantity of \'L\' and \'R\' characters.\nGiven a balanced string s, split it in the maximum amount of balanced strings.\nReturn the maximum amount of split balanced strings.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "RLRRLLRLRL"\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of \'L\' and \'R\'.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "RLLLLRRRLR"\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: s can be split into "RL", "LLLRRR", "LR", each substring contains same number of \'L\' and \'R\'.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s = "LLLLRRRR"\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: s can be split into "LLLLRRRR".\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 1000\ns[i] is either \'L\' or \'R\'.\ns is a balanced string.\n\n'

b'You are given an integer array nums consisting of 2 * n integers.\nYou need to divide nums into n pairs such that:\n\nEach element belongs to exactly one pair.\nThe elements present in a pair are equal.\n\nReturn true if nums can be divided into n pairs, otherwise return false.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [3,2,3,2,2,2]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: \nThere are 6 elements in nums, so they should be divided into 6 / 2 = 3 pairs.\nIf nums is divided into the pairs (2, 2), (3, 3), and (2, 2), it will satisfy all the conditions.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: \nThere is no way to divide nums into 4 / 2 = 2 pairs such that the pairs satisfy every condition.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nnums.length == 2 * n\n1 <= n <= 500\n1 <= nums[i] <= 500\n\n'

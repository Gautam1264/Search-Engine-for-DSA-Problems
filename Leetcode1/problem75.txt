b"Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.\nWe will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.\nYou must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]\nOutput: [0,0,1,1,2,2]\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [2,0,1]\nOutput: [0,1,2]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nn == nums.length\n1 <= n <= 300\nnums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nFollow up:\xc2\xa0Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only\xc2\xa0constant extra space?\n"

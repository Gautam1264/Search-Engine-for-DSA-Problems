b"You are given the logs for users' actions on LeetCode, and an integer k. The logs are represented by a 2D integer array logs where each logs[i] = [IDi, timei] indicates that the user with IDi performed an action at the minute timei.\nMultiple users can perform actions simultaneously, and a single user can perform multiple actions in the same minute.\nThe user active minutes (UAM) for a given user is defined as the number of unique minutes in which the user performed an action on LeetCode. A minute can only be counted once, even if multiple actions occur during it.\nYou are to calculate a 1-indexed array answer of size k such that, for each j (1 <= j <= k), answer[j] is the number of users whose UAM equals j.\nReturn the array answer as described above.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: logs = [[0,5],[1,2],[0,2],[0,5],[1,3]], k = 5\nOutput: [0,2,0,0,0]\nExplanation:\nThe user with ID=0 performed actions at minutes 5, 2, and 5 again. Hence, they have a UAM of 2 (minute 5 is only counted once).\nThe user with ID=1 performed actions at minutes 2 and 3. Hence, they have a UAM of 2.\nSince both users have a UAM of 2, answer[2] is 2, and the remaining answer[j] values are 0.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: logs = [[1,1],[2,2],[2,3]], k = 4\nOutput: [1,1,0,0]\nExplanation:\nThe user with ID=1 performed a single action at minute 1. Hence, they have a UAM of 1.\nThe user with ID=2 performed actions at minutes 2 and 3. Hence, they have a UAM of 2.\nThere is one user with a UAM of 1 and one with a UAM of 2.\nHence, answer[1] = 1, answer[2] = 1, and the remaining values are 0.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= logs.length <= 104\n0 <= IDi <= 109\n1 <= timei <= 105\nk is in the range [The maximum UAM for a user, 105].\n\n"

b'There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course ai first if you want to take course bi.\n\nFor example, the pair [0, 1] indicates that you have to take course 0 before you can take course 1.\n\nPrerequisites can also be indirect. If course a is a prerequisite of course b, and course b is a prerequisite of course c, then course a is a prerequisite of course c.\nYou are also given an array queries where queries[j] = [uj, vj]. For the jth query, you should answer whether course uj is a prerequisite of course vj or not.\nReturn a boolean array answer, where answer[j] is the answer to the jth query.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]], queries = [[0,1],[1,0]]\nOutput: [false,true]\nExplanation: The pair [1, 0] indicates that you have to take course 1 before you can take course 0.\nCourse 0 is not a prerequisite of course 1, but the opposite is true.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [], queries = [[1,0],[0,1]]\nOutput: [false,false]\nExplanation: There are no prerequisites, and each course is independent.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: numCourses = 3, prerequisites = [[1,2],[1,0],[2,0]], queries = [[1,0],[1,2]]\nOutput: [true,true]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= numCourses <= 100\n0 <= prerequisites.length <= (numCourses * (numCourses - 1) / 2)\nprerequisites[i].length == 2\n0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1\nai != bi\nAll the pairs [ai, bi] are unique.\nThe prerequisites graph has no cycles.\n1 <= queries.length <= 104\n0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1\nui != vi\n\n'

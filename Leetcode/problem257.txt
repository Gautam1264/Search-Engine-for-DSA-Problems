b'Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.\nA subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, [3,6,2,7] is a subsequence of the array [0,3,1,6,2,2,7].\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]\nOutput: 4\n\nExample 3:\nInput: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]\nOutput: 1\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 2500\n-104 <= nums[i] <= 104\n\n\xc2\xa0\nFollow up:\xc2\xa0Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in\xc2\xa0O(n log(n)) time complexity?\n'

b'Given an m x n integers matrix, return the length of the longest increasing path in matrix.\nFrom each cell, you can either move in four directions: left, right, up, or down. You may not move diagonally or move outside the boundary (i.e., wrap-around is not allowed).\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: matrix = [[9,9,4],[6,6,8],[2,1,1]]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: The longest increasing path is [1, 2, 6, 9].\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: matrix = [[3,4,5],[3,2,6],[2,2,1]]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: The longest increasing path is [3, 4, 5, 6]. Moving diagonally is not allowed.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: matrix = [[1]]\nOutput: 1\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nm == matrix.length\nn == matrix[i].length\n1 <= m, n <= 200\n0 <= matrix[i][j] <= 231 - 1\n\n'

b'Given a string s, return the number of distinct non-empty subsequences of s. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.\nA subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "abc"\nOutput: 7\nExplanation: The 7 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", and "abc".\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "aba"\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The 6 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "ab", "aa", "ba", and "aba".\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s = "aaa"\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The 3 distinct subsequences are "a", "aa" and "aaa".\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 2000\ns consists of lowercase English letters.\n\n'

b'There is a group of n people labeled from 0 to n - 1 where each person has a different amount of money and a different level of quietness.\nYou are given an array richer where richer[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that ai has more money than bi and an integer array quiet where quiet[i] is the quietness of the ith person. All the given data in richer are logically correct (i.e., the data will not lead you to a situation where x is richer than y and y is richer than x at the same time).\nReturn an integer array answer where answer[x] = y if y is the least quiet person (that is, the person y with the smallest value of quiet[y]) among all people who definitely have equal to or more money than the person x.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: richer = [[1,0],[2,1],[3,1],[3,7],[4,3],[5,3],[6,3]], quiet = [3,2,5,4,6,1,7,0]\nOutput: [5,5,2,5,4,5,6,7]\nExplanation: \nanswer[0] = 5.\nPerson 5 has more money than 3, which has more money than 1, which has more money than 0.\nThe only person who is quieter (has lower quiet[x]) is person 7, but it is not clear if they have more money than person 0.\nanswer[7] = 7.\nAmong all people that definitely have equal to or more money than person 7 (which could be persons 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7), the person who is the quietest (has lower quiet[x]) is person 7.\nThe other answers can be filled out with similar reasoning.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: richer = [], quiet = [0]\nOutput: [0]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nn == quiet.length\n1 <= n <= 500\n0 <= quiet[i] < n\nAll the values of quiet are unique.\n0 <= richer.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2\n0 <= ai, bi < n\nai != bi\nAll the pairs of richer are unique.\nThe observations in richer are all logically consistent.\n\n'

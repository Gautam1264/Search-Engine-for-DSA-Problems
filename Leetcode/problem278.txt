b'Given a sorted integer array nums and an integer n, add/patch elements to the array such that any number in the range [1, n] inclusive can be formed by the sum of some elements in the array.\nReturn the minimum number of patches required.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [1,3], n = 6\nOutput: 1\nExplanation:\nCombinations of nums are [1], [3], [1,3], which form possible sums of: 1, 3, 4.\nNow if we add/patch 2 to nums, the combinations are: [1], [2], [3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3].\nPossible sums are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, which now covers the range [1, 6].\nSo we only need 1 patch.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [1,5,10], n = 20\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The two patches can be [2, 4].\n\nExample 3:\nInput: nums = [1,2,2], n = 5\nOutput: 0\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 1000\n1 <= nums[i] <= 104\nnums is sorted in ascending order.\n1 <= n <= 231 - 1\n\n'

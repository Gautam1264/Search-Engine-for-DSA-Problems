b'You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:\n\n0 representing an empty cell,\n1 representing a fresh orange, or\n2 representing a rotten orange.\n\nEvery minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.\nReturn the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return -1.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]\nOutput: 4\n\nExample 2:\nInput: grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: grid = [[0,2]]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nm == grid.length\nn == grid[i].length\n1 <= m, n <= 10\ngrid[i][j] is 0, 1, or 2.\n\n'

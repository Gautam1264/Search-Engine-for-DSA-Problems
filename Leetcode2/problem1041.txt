b'Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of values of nodes with an even-valued grandparent. If there are no nodes with an even-valued grandparent, return 0.\nA grandparent of a node is the parent of its parent if it exists.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [6,7,8,2,7,1,3,9,null,1,4,null,null,null,5]\nOutput: 18\nExplanation: The red nodes are the nodes with even-value grandparent while the blue nodes are the even-value grandparents.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [1]\nOutput: 0\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].\n1 <= Node.val <= 100\n\n'

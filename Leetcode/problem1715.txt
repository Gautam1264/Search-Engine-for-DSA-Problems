b'You are given a 0-indexed array nums consisting of n positive integers.\nThe array nums is called alternating if:\n\nnums[i - 2] == nums[i], where 2 <= i <= n - 1.\nnums[i - 1] != nums[i], where 1 <= i <= n - 1.\n\nIn one operation, you can choose an index i and change nums[i] into any positive integer.\nReturn the minimum number of operations required to make the array alternating.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [3,1,3,2,4,3]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:\nOne way to make the array alternating is by converting it to [3,1,3,1,3,1].\nThe number of operations required in this case is 3.\nIt can be proven that it is not possible to make the array alternating in less than 3 operations. \n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [1,2,2,2,2]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation:\nOne way to make the array alternating is by converting it to [1,2,1,2,1].\nThe number of operations required in this case is 2.\nNote that the array cannot be converted to [2,2,2,2,2] because in this case nums[0] == nums[1] which violates the conditions of an alternating array.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 105\n1 <= nums[i] <= 105\n\n'

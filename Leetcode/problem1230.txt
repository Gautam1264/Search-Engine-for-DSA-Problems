b'Given an array nums and an integer target, return the maximum number of non-empty non-overlapping subarrays such that the sum of values in each subarray is equal to target.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [1,1,1,1,1], target = 2\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: There are 2 non-overlapping subarrays [1,1,1,1,1] with sum equals to target(2).\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [-1,3,5,1,4,2,-9], target = 6\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: There are 3 subarrays with sum equal to 6.\n([5,1], [4,2], [3,5,1,4,2,-9]) but only the first 2 are non-overlapping.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 105\n-104 <= nums[i] <= 104\n0 <= target <= 106\n\n'

b"You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer val.\nFind the node in the BST that the node's value equals val and return the subtree rooted with that node. If such a node does not exist, return null.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 2\nOutput: [2,1,3]\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 5\nOutput: []\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 5000].\n1 <= Node.val <= 107\nroot is a binary search tree.\n1 <= val <= 107\n\n"

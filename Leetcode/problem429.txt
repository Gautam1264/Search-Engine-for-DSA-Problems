b'Given two strings a and b, return the length of the longest uncommon subsequence between a and b. If the longest uncommon subsequence does not exist, return -1.\nAn uncommon subsequence between two strings is a string that is a subsequence of one but not the other.\nA subsequence of a string s is a string that can be obtained after deleting any number of characters from s.\n\nFor example, "abc" is a subsequence of "aebdc" because you can delete the underlined characters in "aebdc" to get "abc". Other subsequences of "aebdc" include "aebdc", "aeb", and "" (empty string).\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: a = "aba", b = "cdc"\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: One longest uncommon subsequence is "aba" because "aba" is a subsequence of "aba" but not "cdc".\nNote that "cdc" is also a longest uncommon subsequence.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: a = "aaa", b = "bbb"\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:\xc2\xa0The longest uncommon subsequences are "aaa" and "bbb".\n\nExample 3:\nInput: a = "aaa", b = "aaa"\nOutput: -1\nExplanation:\xc2\xa0Every subsequence of string a is also a subsequence of string b. Similarly, every subsequence of string b is also a subsequence of string a.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= a.length, b.length <= 100\na and b consist of lower-case English letters.\n\n'

b'The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:\n\ncountAndSay(1) = "1"\ncountAndSay(n) is the way you would "say" the digit string from countAndSay(n-1), which is then converted into a different digit string.\n\nTo determine how you "say" a digit string, split it into the minimal number of groups so that each group is a contiguous section all of the same character. Then for each group, say the number of characters, then say the character. To convert the saying into a digit string, replace the counts with a number and concatenate every saying.\nFor example, the saying and conversion for digit string "3322251":\n\nGiven a positive integer n, return the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 1\nOutput: "1"\nExplanation: This is the base case.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 4\nOutput: "1211"\nExplanation:\ncountAndSay(1) = "1"\ncountAndSay(2) = say "1" = one 1 = "11"\ncountAndSay(3) = say "11" = two 1\'s = "21"\ncountAndSay(4) = say "21" = one 2 + one 1 = "12" + "11" = "1211"\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 30\n\n'

b'A magical string s consists of only \'1\' and \'2\' and obeys the following rules:\n\nThe string s is magical because concatenating the number of contiguous occurrences of characters \'1\' and \'2\' generates the string s itself.\n\nThe first few elements of s is s = "1221121221221121122\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6". If we group the consecutive 1\'s and 2\'s in s, it will be "1 22 11 2 1 22 1 22 11 2 11 22 ......" and the occurrences of 1\'s or 2\'s in each group are "1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 ......". You can see that the occurrence sequence is s itself.\nGiven an integer n, return the number of 1\'s in the first n number in the magical string s.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 6\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The first 6 elements of magical string s is "122112" and it contains three 1\'s, so return 3.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 1\nOutput: 1\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 105\n\n'

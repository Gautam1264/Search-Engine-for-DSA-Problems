b"Given an n-ary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values.\nNary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]\nOutput: [[1],[3,2,4],[5,6]]\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]\nOutput: [[1],[2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9,10],[11,12,13],[14]]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe height of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to 1000\nThe total number of nodes is between [0, 104]\n\n"

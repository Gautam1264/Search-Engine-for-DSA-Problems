b'Given two strings s and part, perform the following operation on s until all occurrences of the substring part are removed:\n\nFind the leftmost occurrence of the substring part and remove it from s.\n\nReturn s after removing all occurrences of part.\nA substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "daabcbaabcbc", part = "abc"\nOutput: "dab"\nExplanation: The following operations are done:\n- s = "daabcbaabcbc", remove "abc" starting at index 2, so s = "dabaabcbc".\n- s = "dabaabcbc", remove "abc" starting at index 4, so s = "dababc".\n- s = "dababc", remove "abc" starting at index 3, so s = "dab".\nNow s has no occurrences of "abc".\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "axxxxyyyyb", part = "xy"\nOutput: "ab"\nExplanation: The following operations are done:\n- s = "axxxxyyyyb", remove "xy" starting at index 4 so s = "axxxyyyb".\n- s = "axxxyyyb", remove "xy" starting at index 3 so s = "axxyyb".\n- s = "axxyyb", remove "xy" starting at index 2 so s = "axyb".\n- s = "axyb", remove "xy" starting at index 1 so s = "ab".\nNow s has no occurrences of "xy".\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 1000\n1 <= part.length <= 1000\ns\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b and part consists of lowercase English letters.\n\n'

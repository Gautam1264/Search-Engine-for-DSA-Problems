b'Given a 0-indexed string word and a character ch, reverse the segment of word that starts at index 0 and ends at the index of the first occurrence of ch (inclusive). If the character ch does not exist in word, do nothing.\n\nFor example, if word = "abcdefd" and ch = "d", then you should reverse the segment that starts at 0 and ends at 3 (inclusive). The resulting string will be "dcbaefd".\n\nReturn the resulting string.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: word = "abcdefd", ch = "d"\nOutput: "dcbaefd"\nExplanation:\xc2\xa0The first occurrence of "d" is at index 3. \nReverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "dcbaefd".\n\nExample 2:\nInput: word = "xyxzxe", ch = "z"\nOutput: "zxyxxe"\nExplanation:\xc2\xa0The first and only occurrence of "z" is at index 3.\nReverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "zxyxxe".\n\nExample 3:\nInput: word = "abcd", ch = "z"\nOutput: "abcd"\nExplanation:\xc2\xa0"z" does not exist in word.\nYou should not do any reverse operation, the resulting string is "abcd".\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= word.length <= 250\nword consists of lowercase English letters.\nch is a lowercase English letter.\n\n'

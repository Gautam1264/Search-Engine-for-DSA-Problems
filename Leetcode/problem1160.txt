b'Given a binary tree where node values are digits from 1 to 9. A path in the binary tree is said to be pseudo-palindromic if at least one permutation of the node values in the path is a palindrome.\nReturn the number of pseudo-palindromic paths going from the root node to leaf nodes.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [2,3,1,3,1,null,1]\nOutput: 2 \nExplanation: The figure above represents the given binary tree. There are three paths going from the root node to leaf nodes: the red path [2,3,3], the green path [2,1,1], and the path [2,3,1]. Among these paths only red path and green path are pseudo-palindromic paths since the red path [2,3,3] can be rearranged in [3,2,3] (palindrome) and the green path [2,1,1] can be rearranged in [1,2,1] (palindrome).\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [2,1,1,1,3,null,null,null,null,null,1]\nOutput: 1 \nExplanation: The figure above represents the given binary tree. There are three paths going from the root node to leaf nodes: the green path [2,1,1], the path [2,1,3,1], and the path [2,1]. Among these paths only the green path is pseudo-palindromic since [2,1,1] can be rearranged in [1,2,1] (palindrome).\n\nExample 3:\nInput: root = [9]\nOutput: 1\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 105].\n1 <= Node.val <= 9\n\n'

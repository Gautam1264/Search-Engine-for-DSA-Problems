b'You are given a string s of length n, and an integer k. You are tasked to find the longest subsequence repeated k times in string s.\nA subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.\nA subsequence seq is repeated k times in the string s if seq * k is a subsequence of s, where seq * k represents a string constructed by concatenating seq k times.\n\nFor example, "bba" is repeated 2 times in the string "bababcba", because the string "bbabba", constructed by concatenating "bba" 2 times, is a subsequence of the string "bababcba".\n\nReturn the longest subsequence repeated k times in string s. If multiple such subsequences are found, return the lexicographically largest one. If there is no such subsequence, return an empty string.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = "letsleetcode", k = 2\nOutput: "let"\nExplanation: There are two longest subsequences repeated 2 times: "let" and "ete".\n"let" is the lexicographically largest one.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "bb", k = 2\nOutput: "b"\nExplanation: The longest subsequence repeated 2 times is "b".\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s = "ab", k = 2\nOutput: ""\nExplanation: There is no subsequence repeated 2 times. Empty string is returned.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nn == s.length\n2 <= n, k <= 2000\n2 <= n < k * 8\ns consists of lowercase English letters.\n\n'

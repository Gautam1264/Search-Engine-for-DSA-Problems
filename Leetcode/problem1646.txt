b'Given two string arrays words1 and words2, return the number of strings that appear exactly once in each\xc2\xa0of the two arrays.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: words1 = ["leetcode","is","amazing","as","is"], words2 = ["amazing","leetcode","is"]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation:\n- "leetcode" appears exactly once in each of the two arrays. We count this string.\n- "amazing" appears exactly once in each of the two arrays. We count this string.\n- "is" appears in each of the two arrays, but there are 2 occurrences of it in words1. We do not count this string.\n- "as" appears once in words1, but does not appear in words2. We do not count this string.\nThus, there are 2 strings that appear exactly once in each of the two arrays.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: words1 = ["b","bb","bbb"], words2 = ["a","aa","aaa"]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: There are no strings that appear in each of the two arrays.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: words1 = ["a","ab"], words2 = ["a","a","a","ab"]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: The only string that appears exactly once in each of the two arrays is "ab".\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= words1.length, words2.length <= 1000\n1 <= words1[i].length, words2[j].length <= 30\nwords1[i] and words2[j] consists only of lowercase English letters.\n\n'

b'In a garden represented as an infinite 2D grid, there is an apple tree planted at every integer coordinate. The apple tree planted at an integer coordinate (i, j) has |i| + |j| apples growing on it.\nYou will buy an axis-aligned square plot of land that is centered at (0, 0).\nGiven an integer neededApples, return the minimum perimeter of a plot such that at least neededApples apples are inside or on the perimeter of that plot.\nThe value of |x| is defined as:\n\nx if x >= 0\n-x if x < 0\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: neededApples = 1\nOutput: 8\nExplanation: A square plot of side length 1 does not contain any apples.\nHowever, a square plot of side length 2 has 12 apples inside (as depicted in the image above).\nThe perimeter is 2 * 4 = 8.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: neededApples = 13\nOutput: 16\n\nExample 3:\nInput: neededApples = 1000000000\nOutput: 5040\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= neededApples <= 1015\n\n'

b'An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.\nGiven an integer n, return the nth ugly number.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 10\nOutput: 12\nExplanation: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12] is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 1\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 1690\n\n'

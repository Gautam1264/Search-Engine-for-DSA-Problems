b'You are given an array points representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D-plane, where points[i] = [xi, yi].\nThe cost of connecting two points [xi, yi] and [xj, yj] is the manhattan distance between them: |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|, where |val| denotes the absolute value of val.\nReturn the minimum cost to make all points connected. All points are connected if there is exactly one simple path between any two points.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: points = [[0,0],[2,2],[3,10],[5,2],[7,0]]\nOutput: 20\nExplanation: \n\nWe can connect the points as shown above to get the minimum cost of 20.\nNotice that there is a unique path between every pair of points.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: points = [[3,12],[-2,5],[-4,1]]\nOutput: 18\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= points.length <= 1000\n-106 <= xi, yi <= 106\nAll pairs (xi, yi) are distinct.\n\n'

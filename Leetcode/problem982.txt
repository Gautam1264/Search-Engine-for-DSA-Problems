b'n passengers board an airplane with exactly n seats. The first passenger has lost the ticket and picks a seat randomly. But after that, the rest of the passengers will:\n\nTake their own seat if it is still available, and\nPick other seats randomly when they find their seat occupied\n\nReturn the probability that the nth person gets his own seat.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 1\nOutput: 1.00000\nExplanation: The first person can only get the first seat.\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 2\nOutput: 0.50000\nExplanation: The second person has a probability of 0.5 to get the second seat (when first person gets the first seat).\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 105\n\n'

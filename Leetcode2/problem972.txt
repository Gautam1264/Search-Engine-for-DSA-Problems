b"In an\xc2\xa0n*n\xc2\xa0grid, there is a snake that spans 2 cells and starts moving from the top left corner at (0, 0) and (0, 1). The grid has empty cells represented by zeros and blocked cells represented by ones. The snake wants to reach the lower right corner at\xc2\xa0(n-1, n-2)\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0(n-1, n-1).\nIn one move the snake can:\n\nMove one cell to the right\xc2\xa0if there are no blocked cells there. This move keeps the horizontal/vertical position of the snake as it is.\nMove down one cell\xc2\xa0if there are no blocked cells there. This move keeps the horizontal/vertical position of the snake as it is.\nRotate clockwise if it's in a horizontal position and the two cells under it are both empty. In that case the snake moves from\xc2\xa0(r, c)\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0(r, c+1)\xc2\xa0to\xc2\xa0(r, c)\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0(r+1, c).\n\nRotate counterclockwise\xc2\xa0if it's in a vertical position and the two cells to its right are both empty. In that case the snake moves from\xc2\xa0(r, c)\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0(r+1, c)\xc2\xa0to\xc2\xa0(r, c)\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0(r, c+1).\n\n\nReturn the minimum number of moves to reach the target.\nIf there is no way to reach the target, return\xc2\xa0-1.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,1],\n               [1,1,0,0,1,0],\n\xc2\xa0              [0,0,0,0,1,1],\n\xc2\xa0              [0,0,1,0,1,0],\n\xc2\xa0              [0,1,1,0,0,0],\n\xc2\xa0              [0,1,1,0,0,0]]\nOutput: 11\nExplanation:\nOne possible solution is [right, right, rotate clockwise, right, down, down, down, down, rotate counterclockwise, right, down].\n\nExample 2:\nInput: grid = [[0,0,1,1,1,1],\n\xc2\xa0              [0,0,0,0,1,1],\n\xc2\xa0              [1,1,0,0,0,1],\n\xc2\xa0              [1,1,1,0,0,1],\n\xc2\xa0              [1,1,1,0,0,1],\n\xc2\xa0              [1,1,1,0,0,0]]\nOutput: 9\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= n <= 100\n0 <= grid[i][j] <= 1\nIt is guaranteed that the snake starts at empty cells.\n\n"

b'Given an m x n binary matrix filled with 0\'s and 1\'s, find the largest square containing only 1\'s and return its area.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]\nOutput: 4\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: matrix = [["0","1"],["1","0"]]\nOutput: 1\n\nExample 3:\nInput: matrix = [["0"]]\nOutput: 0\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nm == matrix.length\nn == matrix[i].length\n1 <= m, n <= 300\nmatrix[i][j] is \'0\' or \'1\'.\n\n'

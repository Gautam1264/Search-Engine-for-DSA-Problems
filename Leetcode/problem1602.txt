b'You are given a string s consisting of n characters which are either \'X\' or \'O\'.\nA move is defined as selecting three consecutive characters of s and converting them to \'O\'. Note that if a move is applied to the character \'O\', it will stay the same.\nReturn the minimum number of moves required so that all the characters of s are converted to \'O\'.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "XXX"\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: XXX -> OOO\nWe select all the 3 characters and convert them in one move.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "XXOX"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: XXOX -> OOOX -> OOOO\nWe select the first 3 characters in the first move, and convert them to \'O\'.\nThen we select the last 3 characters and convert them so that the final string contains all \'O\'s.\nExample 3:\nInput: s = "OOOO"\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: There are no \'X\'s in s to convert.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n3 <= s.length <= 1000\ns[i] is either \'X\' or \'O\'.\n\n'

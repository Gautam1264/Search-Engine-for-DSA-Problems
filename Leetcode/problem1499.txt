b'You are given a 2D integer array ranges and two integers left and right. Each ranges[i] = [starti, endi] represents an inclusive interval between starti and endi.\nReturn true if each integer in the inclusive range [left, right] is covered by at least one interval in ranges. Return false otherwise.\nAn integer x is covered by an interval ranges[i] = [starti, endi] if starti <= x <= endi.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: ranges = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]], left = 2, right = 5\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Every integer between 2 and 5 is covered:\n- 2 is covered by the first range.\n- 3 and 4 are covered by the second range.\n- 5 is covered by the third range.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: ranges = [[1,10],[10,20]], left = 21, right = 21\nOutput: false\nExplanation: 21 is not covered by any range.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= ranges.length <= 50\n1 <= starti <= endi <= 50\n1 <= left <= right <= 50\n\n'

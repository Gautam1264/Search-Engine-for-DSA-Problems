b'Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return all root-to-leaf paths where the sum of the node values in the path equals targetSum. Each path should be returned as a list of the node values, not node references.\nA root-to-leaf path is a path starting from the root and ending at any leaf node. A leaf is a node with no children.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], targetSum = 22\nOutput: [[5,4,11,2],[5,8,4,5]]\nExplanation: There are two paths whose sum equals targetSum:\n5 + 4 + 11 + 2 = 22\n5 + 8 + 4 + 5 = 22\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5\nOutput: []\n\nExample 3:\nInput: root = [1,2], targetSum = 0\nOutput: []\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].\n-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000\n-1000 <= targetSum <= 1000\n\n'

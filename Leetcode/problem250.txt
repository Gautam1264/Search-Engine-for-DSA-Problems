b'Given an array of integers nums containing\xc2\xa0n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.\nThere is only one repeated number in nums, return this\xc2\xa0repeated\xc2\xa0number.\nYou must solve the problem without modifying the array nums\xc2\xa0and uses only constant extra space.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]\nOutput: 2\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]\nOutput: 3\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 105\nnums.length == n + 1\n1 <= nums[i] <= n\nAll the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nFollow up:\n\nHow can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in nums?\nCan you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?\n\n'

b'There is a programming language with only four operations and one variable X:\n\n++X and X++ increments the value of the variable X by 1.\n--X and X-- decrements the value of the variable X by 1.\n\nInitially, the value of X is 0.\nGiven an array of strings operations containing a list of operations, return the final value of X after performing all the operations.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: operations = ["--X","X++","X++"]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation:\xc2\xa0The operations are performed as follows:\nInitially, X = 0.\n--X: X is decremented by 1, X =  0 - 1 = -1.\nX++: X is incremented by 1, X = -1 + 1 =  0.\nX++: X is incremented by 1, X =  0 + 1 =  1.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: operations = ["++X","++X","X++"]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The operations are performed as follows:\nInitially, X = 0.\n++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.\n++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.\nX++: X is incremented by 1, X = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: operations = ["X++","++X","--X","X--"]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation:\xc2\xa0The operations are performed as follows:\nInitially, X = 0.\nX++: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.\n++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.\n--X: X is decremented by 1, X = 2 - 1 = 1.\nX--: X is decremented by 1, X = 1 - 1 = 0.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= operations.length <= 100\noperations[i] will be either "++X", "X++", "--X", or "X--".\n\n'

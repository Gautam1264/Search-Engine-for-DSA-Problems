b'No-Zero integer is a positive integer that does not contain any 0 in its decimal representation.\nGiven an integer n, return a list of two integers [A, B] where:\n\nA and B are No-Zero integers.\nA + B = n\n\nThe test cases are generated so that there is at least one valid solution. If there are many valid solutions you can return any of them.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 2\nOutput: [1,1]\nExplanation: A = 1, B = 1. A + B = n and both A and B do not contain any 0 in their decimal representation.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 11\nOutput: [2,9]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= n <= 104\n\n'

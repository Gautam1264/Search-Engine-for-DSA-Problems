b'You are given an integer array cards of length 4. You have four cards, each containing a number in the range [1, 9]. You should arrange the numbers on these cards in a mathematical expression using the operators [\'+\', \'-\', \'*\', \'/\'] and the parentheses \'(\' and \')\' to get the value 24.\nYou are restricted with the following rules:\n\nThe division operator \'/\' represents real division, not integer division.\n\n\t\nFor example, 4 / (1 - 2 / 3) = 4 / (1 / 3) = 12.\n\n\nEvery operation done is between two numbers. In particular, we cannot use \'-\' as a unary operator.\n\t\nFor example, if cards = [1, 1, 1, 1], the expression "-1 - 1 - 1 - 1" is not allowed.\n\n\nYou cannot concatenate numbers together\n\t\nFor example, if cards = [1, 2, 1, 2], the expression "12 + 12" is not valid.\n\n\n\nReturn true if you can get such expression that evaluates to 24, and false otherwise.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: cards = [4,1,8,7]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: (8-4) * (7-1) = 24\n\nExample 2:\nInput: cards = [1,2,1,2]\nOutput: false\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\ncards.length == 4\n1 <= cards[i] <= 9\n\n'

b'You are given a string s and an array of strings words of the same length. Return\xc2\xa0all starting indices of substring(s) in s\xc2\xa0that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once, in any order,\xc2\xa0and without any intervening characters.\nYou can return the answer in any order.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "barfoothefoobarman", words = ["foo","bar"]\nOutput: [0,9]\nExplanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoo" and "foobar" respectively.\nThe output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword", words = ["word","good","best","word"]\nOutput: []\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s = "barfoofoobarthefoobarman", words = ["bar","foo","the"]\nOutput: [6,9,12]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 104\ns consists of lower-case English letters.\n1 <= words.length <= 5000\n1 <= words[i].length <= 30\nwords[i]\xc2\xa0consists of lower-case English letters.\n\n'

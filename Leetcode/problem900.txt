b'There is a set of n items. You are given two integer arrays values and labels where the value and the label of the ith element are values[i] and labels[i] respectively. You are also given two integers numWanted and useLimit.\nChoose a subset s of the n elements such that:\n\nThe size of the subset s is less than or equal to numWanted.\nThere are at most useLimit items with the same label in s.\n\nThe score of a subset is the sum of the values in the subset.\nReturn the maximum score of a subset s.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: values = [5,4,3,2,1], labels = [1,1,2,2,3], numWanted = 3, useLimit = 1\nOutput: 9\nExplanation: The subset chosen is the first, third, and fifth items.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: values = [5,4,3,2,1], labels = [1,3,3,3,2], numWanted = 3, useLimit = 2\nOutput: 12\nExplanation: The subset chosen is the first, second, and third items.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: values = [9,8,8,7,6], labels = [0,0,0,1,1], numWanted = 3, useLimit = 1\nOutput: 16\nExplanation: The subset chosen is the first and fourth items.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nn == values.length == labels.length\n1 <= n <= 2 * 104\n0 <= values[i], labels[i] <= 2 * 104\n1 <= numWanted, useLimit <= n\n\n'

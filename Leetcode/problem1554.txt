b'You are given a 0-indexed string s of even length n. The string consists of exactly n / 2 opening brackets \'[\' and n / 2 closing brackets \']\'.\nA string is called balanced if and only if:\n\nIt is the empty string, or\nIt can be written as AB, where both A and B are balanced strings, or\nIt can be written as [C], where C is a balanced string.\n\nYou may swap the brackets at any two indices any number of times.\nReturn the minimum number of swaps to make s balanced.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "][]["\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: You can make the string balanced by swapping index 0 with index 3.\nThe resulting string is "[[]]".\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "]]][[["\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: You can do the following to make the string balanced:\n- Swap index 0 with index 4. s = "[]][][".\n- Swap index 1 with index 5. s = "[[][]]".\nThe resulting string is "[[][]]".\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s = "[]"\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: The string is already balanced.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nn == s.length\n2 <= n <= 106\nn is even.\ns[i] is either \'[\' or \']\'.\nThe number of opening brackets \'[\' equals n / 2, and the number of closing brackets \']\' equals n / 2.\n\n'

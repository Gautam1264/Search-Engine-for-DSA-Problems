b'You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. Append k unique positive integers that do not appear in nums to nums such that the resulting total sum is minimum.\nReturn the sum of the k integers appended to nums.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [1,4,25,10,25], k = 2\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: The two unique positive integers that do not appear in nums which we append are 2 and 3.\nThe resulting sum of nums is 1 + 4 + 25 + 10 + 25 + 2 + 3 = 70, which is the minimum.\nThe sum of the two integers appended is 2 + 3 = 5, so we return 5.\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [5,6], k = 6\nOutput: 25\nExplanation: The six unique positive integers that do not appear in nums which we append are 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8.\nThe resulting sum of nums is 5 + 6 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 8 = 36, which is the minimum. \nThe sum of the six integers appended is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 8 = 25, so we return 25.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 105\n1 <= nums[i] <= 109\n1 <= k <= 108\n\n'

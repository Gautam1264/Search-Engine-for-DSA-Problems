b'You are given a string num, which represents a large integer. You are also given a 0-indexed integer array change of length 10 that maps each digit 0-9 to another digit. More formally, digit d maps to digit change[d].\nYou may choose to mutate a single substring of num. To mutate a substring, replace each digit num[i] with the digit it maps to in change (i.e. replace num[i] with change[num[i]]).\nReturn a string representing the largest possible integer after mutating (or choosing not to) a single substring of num.\nA substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: num = "132", change = [9,8,5,0,3,6,4,2,6,8]\nOutput: "832"\nExplanation: Replace the substring "1":\n- 1 maps to change[1] = 8.\nThus, "132" becomes "832".\n"832" is the largest number that can be created, so return it.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: num = "021", change = [9,4,3,5,7,2,1,9,0,6]\nOutput: "934"\nExplanation: Replace the substring "021":\n- 0 maps to change[0] = 9.\n- 2 maps to change[2] = 3.\n- 1 maps to change[1] = 4.\nThus, "021" becomes "934".\n"934" is the largest number that can be created, so return it.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: num = "5", change = [1,4,7,5,3,2,5,6,9,4]\nOutput: "5"\nExplanation: "5" is already the largest number that can be created, so return it.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= num.length <= 105\nnum consists of only digits 0-9.\nchange.length == 10\n0 <= change[d] <= 9\n\n'

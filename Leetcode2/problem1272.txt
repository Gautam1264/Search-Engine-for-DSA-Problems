b'A kingdom consists of a king, his children, his grandchildren, and so on. Every once in a while, someone in the family dies or a child is born.\nThe kingdom has a well-defined order of inheritance that consists of the king as the first member. Let\'s define the recursive function Successor(x, curOrder), which given a person x and the inheritance order so far, returns who should be the next person after x in the order of inheritance.\nSuccessor(x, curOrder):\n    if x has no children or all of x\'s children are in curOrder:\n        if x is the king return null\n        else return Successor(x\'s parent, curOrder)\n    else return x\'s oldest child who\'s not in curOrder\n\nFor example, assume we have a kingdom that consists of the king, his children Alice and Bob (Alice is older than Bob), and finally Alice\'s son Jack.\n\nIn the beginning, curOrder will be ["king"].\nCalling Successor(king, curOrder) will return Alice, so we append to curOrder to get ["king", "Alice"].\nCalling Successor(Alice, curOrder) will return Jack, so we append to curOrder to get ["king", "Alice", "Jack"].\nCalling Successor(Jack, curOrder) will return Bob, so we append to curOrder to get ["king", "Alice", "Jack", "Bob"].\nCalling Successor(Bob, curOrder) will return null. Thus the order of inheritance will be ["king", "Alice", "Jack", "Bob"].\n\nUsing the above function, we can always obtain a unique order of inheritance.\nImplement the ThroneInheritance class:\n\nThroneInheritance(string kingName) Initializes an object of the ThroneInheritance class. The name of the king is given as part of the constructor.\nvoid birth(string parentName, string childName) Indicates that parentName gave birth to childName.\nvoid death(string name) Indicates the death of name. The death of the person doesn\'t affect the Successor function nor the current inheritance order. You can treat it as just marking the person as dead.\nstring[] getInheritanceOrder() Returns a list representing the current order of inheritance excluding dead people.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput\n["ThroneInheritance", "birth", "birth", "birth", "birth", "birth", "birth", "getInheritanceOrder", "death", "getInheritanceOrder"]\n[["king"], ["king", "andy"], ["king", "bob"], ["king", "catherine"], ["andy", "matthew"], ["bob", "alex"], ["bob", "asha"], [null], ["bob"], [null]]\nOutput\n[null, null, null, null, null, null, null, ["king", "andy", "matthew", "bob", "alex", "asha", "catherine"], null, ["king", "andy", "matthew", "alex", "asha", "catherine"]]\n\nExplanation\nThroneInheritance t= new ThroneInheritance("king"); // order: king\nt.birth("king", "andy"); // order: king > andy\nt.birth("king", "bob"); // order: king > andy > bob\nt.birth("king", "catherine"); // order: king > andy > bob > catherine\nt.birth("andy", "matthew"); // order: king > andy > matthew > bob > catherine\nt.birth("bob", "alex"); // order: king > andy > matthew > bob > alex > catherine\nt.birth("bob", "asha"); // order: king > andy > matthew > bob > alex > asha > catherine\nt.getInheritanceOrder(); // return ["king", "andy", "matthew", "bob", "alex", "asha", "catherine"]\nt.death("bob"); // order: king > andy > matthew > bob > alex > asha > catherine\nt.getInheritanceOrder(); // return ["king", "andy", "matthew", "alex", "asha", "catherine"]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= kingName.length, parentName.length, childName.length, name.length <= 15\nkingName, parentName, childName, and name consist of lowercase English letters only.\nAll arguments childName and kingName are distinct.\nAll name arguments of death will be passed to either the constructor or as childName to birth first.\nFor each call to\xc2\xa0birth(parentName, childName), it is guaranteed that\xc2\xa0parentName is alive.\nAt most 105 calls will be made to birth and death.\nAt most 10 calls will be made to getInheritanceOrder.\n\n'

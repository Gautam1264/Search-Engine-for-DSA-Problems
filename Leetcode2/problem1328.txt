b"Given an integer array nums and a positive integer k, return the most competitive subsequence of nums of size k.\nAn array's subsequence is a resulting sequence obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array.\nWe define that a subsequence a is more competitive than a subsequence b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, subsequence a has a number less than the corresponding number in b. For example, [1,3,4] is more competitive than [1,3,5] because the first position they differ is at the final number, and 4 is less than 5.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [3,5,2,6], k = 2\nOutput: [2,6]\nExplanation: Among the set of every possible subsequence: {[3,5], [3,2], [3,6], [5,2], [5,6], [2,6]}, [2,6] is the most competitive.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [2,4,3,3,5,4,9,6], k = 4\nOutput: [2,3,3,4]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 105\n0 <= nums[i] <= 109\n1 <= k <= nums.length\n\n"

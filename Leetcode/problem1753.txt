b'There are n piles of coins on a table. Each pile consists of a positive number of coins of assorted denominations.\nIn one move, you can choose any coin on top of any pile, remove it, and add it to your wallet.\nGiven a list piles, where piles[i] is a list of integers denoting the composition of the ith pile from top to bottom, and a positive integer k, return the maximum total value of coins you can have in your wallet if you choose exactly k coins optimally.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: piles = [[1,100,3],[7,8,9]], k = 2\nOutput: 101\nExplanation:\nThe above diagram shows the different ways we can choose k coins.\nThe maximum total we can obtain is 101.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: piles = [[100],[100],[100],[100],[100],[100],[1,1,1,1,1,1,700]], k = 7\nOutput: 706\nExplanation:\nThe maximum total can be obtained if we choose all coins from the last pile.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nn == piles.length\n1 <= n <= 1000\n1 <= piles[i][j] <= 105\n1 <= k <= sum(piles[i].length) <= 2000\n\n'

b'Given an array nums of n integers where nums[i] is in the range [1, n], return an array of all the integers in the range [1, n] that do not appear in nums.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]\nOutput: [5,6]\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [1,1]\nOutput: [2]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nn == nums.length\n1 <= n <= 105\n1 <= nums[i] <= n\n\n\xc2\xa0\nFollow up: Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.\n'

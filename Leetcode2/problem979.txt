b'A die simulator generates a random number from 1 to 6 for each roll. You introduced a constraint to the generator such that it cannot roll the number i more than rollMax[i] (1-indexed) consecutive times.\nGiven an array of integers rollMax and an integer n, return the number of distinct sequences that can be obtained with exact n rolls. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.\nTwo sequences are considered different if at least one element differs from each other.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 2, rollMax = [1,1,2,2,2,3]\nOutput: 34\nExplanation: There will be 2 rolls of die, if there are no constraints on the die, there are 6 * 6 = 36 possible combinations. In this case, looking at rollMax array, the numbers 1 and 2 appear at most once consecutively, therefore sequences (1,1) and (2,2) cannot occur, so the final answer is 36-2 = 34.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 2, rollMax = [1,1,1,1,1,1]\nOutput: 30\n\nExample 3:\nInput: n = 3, rollMax = [1,1,1,2,2,3]\nOutput: 181\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 5000\nrollMax.length == 6\n1 <= rollMax[i] <= 15\n\n'

b'There is a malfunctioning keyboard where some letter keys do not work. All other keys on the keyboard work properly.\nGiven a string text of words separated by a single space (no leading or trailing spaces) and a string brokenLetters of all distinct letter keys that are broken, return the number of words in text you can fully type using this keyboard.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: text = "hello world", brokenLetters = "ad"\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: We cannot type "world" because the \'d\' key is broken.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: text = "leet code", brokenLetters = "lt"\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: We cannot type "leet" because the \'l\' and \'t\' keys are broken.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: text = "leet code", brokenLetters = "e"\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: We cannot type either word because the \'e\' key is broken.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= text.length <= 104\n0 <= brokenLetters.length <= 26\ntext consists of words separated by a single space without any leading or trailing spaces.\nEach word only consists of lowercase English letters.\nbrokenLetters consists of distinct lowercase English letters.\n\n'

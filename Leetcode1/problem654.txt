b'Your car starts at position 0 and speed +1 on an infinite number line. Your car can go into negative positions. Your car drives automatically according to a sequence of instructions \'A\' (accelerate) and \'R\' (reverse):\n\nWhen you get an instruction \'A\', your car does the following:\n\n\t\nposition += speed\nspeed *= 2\n\n\nWhen you get an instruction \'R\', your car does the following:\n\t\nIf your speed is positive then speed = -1\notherwise speed = 1\n\n\tYour position stays the same.\n\nFor example, after commands "AAR", your car goes to positions 0 --> 1 --> 3 --> 3, and your speed goes to 1 --> 2 --> 4 --> -1.\nGiven a target position target, return the length of the shortest sequence of instructions to get there.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: target = 3\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: \nThe shortest instruction sequence is "AA".\nYour position goes from 0 --> 1 --> 3.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: target = 6\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: \nThe shortest instruction sequence is "AAARA".\nYour position goes from 0 --> 1 --> 3 --> 7 --> 7 --> 6.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= target <= 104\n\n'

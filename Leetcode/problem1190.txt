b'You are given an integer n, which indicates that there are n courses labeled from 1 to n. You are also given an array relations where relations[i] = [prevCoursei, nextCoursei], representing a prerequisite relationship between course prevCoursei and course nextCoursei: course prevCoursei has to be taken before course nextCoursei. Also, you are given the integer k.\nIn one semester, you can take at most k courses as long as you have taken all the prerequisites in the previous semesters for the courses you are taking.\nReturn the minimum number of semesters needed to take all courses. The testcases will be generated such that it is possible to take every course.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 4, dependencies = [[2,1],[3,1],[1,4]], k = 2\nOutput: 3 \nExplanation: The figure above represents the given graph.\nIn the first semester, you can take courses 2 and 3.\nIn the second semester, you can take course 1.\nIn the third semester, you can take course 4.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 5, dependencies = [[2,1],[3,1],[4,1],[1,5]], k = 2\nOutput: 4 \nExplanation: The figure above represents the given graph.\nIn the first semester, you can take courses 2 and 3 only since you cannot take more than two per semester.\nIn the second semester, you can take course 4.\nIn the third semester, you can take course 1.\nIn the fourth semester, you can take course 5.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: n = 11, dependencies = [], k = 2\nOutput: 6\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 15\n1 <= k <= n\n0 <= relations.length <= n * (n-1) / 2\nrelations[i].length == 2\n1 <= prevCoursei, nextCoursei <= n\nprevCoursei != nextCoursei\nAll the pairs [prevCoursei, nextCoursei] are unique.\nThe given graph is a directed acyclic graph.\n\n'

b'There are n students in a class numbered from 0 to n - 1. The teacher will give each student a problem starting with the student number 0, then the student number 1, and so on until the teacher reaches the student number n - 1. After that, the teacher will restart the process, starting with the student number 0 again.\nYou are given a 0-indexed integer array chalk and an integer k. There are initially k pieces of chalk. When the student number i is given a problem to solve, they will use chalk[i] pieces of chalk to solve that problem. However, if the current number of chalk pieces is strictly less than chalk[i], then the student number i will be asked to replace the chalk.\nReturn the index of the student that will replace the chalk.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: chalk = [5,1,5], k = 22\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: The students go in turns as follows:\n- Student number 0 uses 5 chalk, so k = 17.\n- Student number 1 uses 1 chalk, so k = 16.\n- Student number 2 uses 5 chalk, so k = 11.\n- Student number 0 uses 5 chalk, so k = 6.\n- Student number 1 uses 1 chalk, so k = 5.\n- Student number 2 uses 5 chalk, so k = 0.\nStudent number 0 does not have enough chalk, so they will have to replace it.\nExample 2:\nInput: chalk = [3,4,1,2], k = 25\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: The students go in turns as follows:\n- Student number 0 uses 3 chalk so k = 22.\n- Student number 1 uses 4 chalk so k = 18.\n- Student number 2 uses 1 chalk so k = 17.\n- Student number 3 uses 2 chalk so k = 15.\n- Student number 0 uses 3 chalk so k = 12.\n- Student number 1 uses 4 chalk so k = 8.\n- Student number 2 uses 1 chalk so k = 7.\n- Student number 3 uses 2 chalk so k = 5.\n- Student number 0 uses 3 chalk so k = 2.\nStudent number 1 does not have enough chalk, so they will have to replace it.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nchalk.length == n\n1 <= n <= 105\n1 <= chalk[i] <= 105\n1 <= k <= 109\n\n'

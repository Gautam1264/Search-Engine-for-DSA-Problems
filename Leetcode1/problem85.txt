b'Given a rows x cols\xc2\xa0binary matrix filled with 0\'s and 1\'s, find the largest rectangle containing only 1\'s and return its area.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The maximal rectangle is shown in the above picture.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: matrix = [["0"]]\nOutput: 0\n\nExample 3:\nInput: matrix = [["1"]]\nOutput: 1\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nrows == matrix.length\ncols == matrix[i].length\n1 <= row, cols <= 200\nmatrix[i][j] is \'0\' or \'1\'.\n\n'

b'Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.\nTwo strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.\nAll occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "egg", t = "add"\nOutput: true\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "foo", t = "bar"\nOutput: false\nExample 3:\nInput: s = "paper", t = "title"\nOutput: true\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104\nt.length == s.length\ns and t consist of any valid ascii character.\n\n'

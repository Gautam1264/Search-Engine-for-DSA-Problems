b'There are n oranges in the kitchen and you decided to eat some of these oranges every day as follows:\n\nEat one orange.\nIf the number of remaining oranges n is divisible by 2 then you can eat n / 2 oranges.\nIf the number of remaining oranges n is divisible by 3 then you can eat 2 * (n / 3) oranges.\n\nYou can only choose one of the actions per day.\nGiven the integer n, return the minimum number of days to eat n oranges.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 10\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: You have 10 oranges.\nDay 1: Eat 1 orange,  10 - 1 = 9.  \nDay 2: Eat 6 oranges, 9 - 2*(9/3) = 9 - 6 = 3. (Since 9 is divisible by 3)\nDay 3: Eat 2 oranges, 3 - 2*(3/3) = 3 - 2 = 1. \nDay 4: Eat the last orange  1 - 1  = 0.\nYou need at least 4 days to eat the 10 oranges.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 6\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: You have 6 oranges.\nDay 1: Eat 3 oranges, 6 - 6/2 = 6 - 3 = 3. (Since 6 is divisible by 2).\nDay 2: Eat 2 oranges, 3 - 2*(3/3) = 3 - 2 = 1. (Since 3 is divisible by 3)\nDay 3: Eat the last orange  1 - 1  = 0.\nYou need at least 3 days to eat the 6 oranges.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 2 * 109\n\n'

b'Given a string s, return the number of homogenous substrings of s. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.\nA string is homogenous if all the characters of the string are the same.\nA substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "abbcccaa"\nOutput: 13\nExplanation: The homogenous substrings are listed as below:\n"a"   appears 3 times.\n"aa"  appears 1 time.\n"b"   appears 2 times.\n"bb"  appears 1 time.\n"c"   appears 3 times.\n"cc"  appears 2 times.\n"ccc" appears 1 time.\n3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 13.\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "xy"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The homogenous substrings are "x" and "y".\nExample 3:\nInput: s = "zzzzz"\nOutput: 15\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 105\ns consists of lowercase letters.\n'

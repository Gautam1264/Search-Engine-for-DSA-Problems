b'You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, where nums[i] is a digit between 0 and 9 (inclusive).\nThe triangular sum of nums is the value of the only element present in nums after the following process terminates:\n\nLet nums comprise of n elements. If n == 1, end the process. Otherwise, create a new 0-indexed integer array newNums of length n - 1.\nFor each index i, where 0 <= i <\xc2\xa0n - 1, assign the value of newNums[i] as (nums[i] + nums[i+1]) % 10, where % denotes modulo operator.\nReplace the array nums with newNums.\nRepeat the entire process starting from step 1.\n\nReturn the triangular sum of nums.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]\nOutput: 8\nExplanation:\nThe above diagram depicts the process from which we obtain the triangular sum of the array.\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [5]\nOutput: 5\nExplanation:\nSince there is only one element in nums, the triangular sum is the value of that element itself.\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 1000\n0 <= nums[i] <= 9\n\n'

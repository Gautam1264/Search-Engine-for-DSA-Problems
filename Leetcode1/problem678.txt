b'You are given a string of digits num, such as "123456579". We can split it into a Fibonacci-like sequence [123, 456, 579].\nFormally, a Fibonacci-like sequence is a list f of non-negative integers such that:\n\n0 <= f[i] < 231, (that is, each integer fits in a 32-bit signed integer type),\nf.length >= 3, and\nf[i] + f[i + 1] == f[i + 2] for all 0 <= i < f.length - 2.\n\nNote that when splitting the string into pieces, each piece must not have extra leading zeroes, except if the piece is the number 0 itself.\nReturn any Fibonacci-like sequence split from num, or return [] if it cannot be done.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: num = "1101111"\nOutput: [11,0,11,11]\nExplanation: The output [110, 1, 111] would also be accepted.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: num = "112358130"\nOutput: []\nExplanation: The task is impossible.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: num = "0123"\nOutput: []\nExplanation: Leading zeroes are not allowed, so "01", "2", "3" is not valid.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= num.length <= 200\nnum contains only digits.\n\n'

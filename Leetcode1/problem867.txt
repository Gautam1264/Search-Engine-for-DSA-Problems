b'Given an integer array nums and two integers firstLen and secondLen, return the maximum sum of elements in two non-overlapping subarrays with lengths firstLen and secondLen.\nThe array with length firstLen could occur before or after the array with length secondLen, but they have to be non-overlapping.\nA subarray is a contiguous part of an array.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [0,6,5,2,2,5,1,9,4], firstLen = 1, secondLen = 2\nOutput: 20\nExplanation: One choice of subarrays is [9] with length 1, and [6,5] with length 2.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [3,8,1,3,2,1,8,9,0], firstLen = 3, secondLen = 2\nOutput: 29\nExplanation: One choice of subarrays is [3,8,1] with length 3, and [8,9] with length 2.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: nums = [2,1,5,6,0,9,5,0,3,8], firstLen = 4, secondLen = 3\nOutput: 31\nExplanation: One choice of subarrays is [5,6,0,9] with length 4, and [0,3,8] with length 3.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= firstLen, secondLen <= 1000\n2 <= firstLen + secondLen <= 1000\nfirstLen + secondLen <= nums.length <= 1000\n0 <= nums[i] <= 1000\n\n'

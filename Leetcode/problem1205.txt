b'You are given an undirected weighted graph of\xc2\xa0n\xc2\xa0nodes (0-indexed), represented by an edge list where\xc2\xa0edges[i] = [a, b]\xc2\xa0is an undirected edge connecting the nodes\xc2\xa0a\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0b\xc2\xa0with a probability of success of traversing that edge\xc2\xa0succProb[i].\nGiven two nodes\xc2\xa0start\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0end, find the path with the maximum probability of success to go from\xc2\xa0start\xc2\xa0to\xc2\xa0end\xc2\xa0and return its success probability.\nIf there is no path from\xc2\xa0start\xc2\xa0to\xc2\xa0end, return\xc2\xa00. Your answer will be accepted if it differs from the correct answer by at most 1e-5.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,2]], succProb = [0.5,0.5,0.2], start = 0, end = 2\nOutput: 0.25000\nExplanation:\xc2\xa0There are two paths from start to end, one having a probability of success = 0.2 and the other has 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,2]], succProb = [0.5,0.5,0.3], start = 0, end = 2\nOutput: 0.30000\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: n = 3, edges = [[0,1]], succProb = [0.5], start = 0, end = 2\nOutput: 0.00000\nExplanation:\xc2\xa0There is no path between 0 and 2.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= n <= 10^4\n0 <= start, end < n\nstart != end\n0 <= a, b < n\na != b\n0 <= succProb.length == edges.length <= 2*10^4\n0 <= succProb[i] <= 1\nThere is at most one edge between every two nodes.\n'

b'Given an array of strings nums containing n unique binary strings each of length n, return a binary string of length n that does not appear in nums. If there are multiple answers, you may return any of them.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = ["01","10"]\nOutput: "11"\nExplanation: "11" does not appear in nums. "00" would also be correct.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = ["00","01"]\nOutput: "11"\nExplanation: "11" does not appear in nums. "10" would also be correct.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: nums = ["111","011","001"]\nOutput: "101"\nExplanation: "101" does not appear in nums. "000", "010", "100", and "110" would also be correct.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nn == nums.length\n1 <= n <= 16\nnums[i].length == n\nnums[i] is either \'0\' or \'1\'.\nAll the strings of nums are unique.\n\n'

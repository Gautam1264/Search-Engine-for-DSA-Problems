b"Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.\nIn a complete binary tree, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with node-values {1} and {2, 3}), and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left as possible.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: The node with value 7 isn't as far left as possible.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].\n1 <= Node.val <= 1000\n\n"

Note that there are many other valid strings such as "ohhh" and "love".\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 2\nOutput: "xy"\nExplanation: "xy" is a valid string since the characters \'x\' and \'y\' occur once. Note that there are many other valid strings such as "ag" and "ur".\n\nExample 3:\nInput: n = 7\nOutput: "holasss"\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 500\n\n'

b'Given a binary tree root, a node X in the tree is named\xc2\xa0good if in the path from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.\nReturn the number of good nodes in the binary tree.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: Nodes in blue are good.\nRoot Node (3) is always a good node.\nNode 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.\nNode 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path\nNode 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path.\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [3,3,null,4,2]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Node 2 -> (3, 3, 2) is not good, because "3" is higher than it.\nExample 3:\nInput: root = [1]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: Root is considered as good.\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the binary tree is in the range\xc2\xa0[1, 10^5].\nEach node\'s value is between [-10^4, 10^4].\n'

b'Two strings X\xc2\xa0and Y\xc2\xa0are similar if we can swap two letters (in different positions) of X, so that\xc2\xa0it equals Y. Also two strings X and Y are similar if they are equal.\nFor example, "tars"\xc2\xa0and "rats"\xc2\xa0are similar (swapping at positions 0 and 2), and "rats" and "arts" are similar, but "star" is not similar to "tars", "rats", or "arts".\nTogether, these form two connected groups by similarity: {"tars", "rats", "arts"} and {"star"}.\xc2\xa0 Notice that "tars" and "arts" are in the same group even though they are not similar.\xc2\xa0 Formally, each group is such that a word is in the group if and only if it is similar to at least one other word in the group.\nWe are given a list strs of strings where every string in strs is an anagram of every other string in strs. How many groups are there?\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: strs = ["tars","rats","arts","star"]\nOutput: 2\n\nExample 2:\nInput: strs = ["omv","ovm"]\nOutput: 1\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= strs.length <= 300\n1 <= strs[i].length <= 300\nstrs[i] consists of lowercase letters only.\nAll words in strs have the same length and are anagrams of each other.\n\n'

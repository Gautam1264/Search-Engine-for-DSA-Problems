b'You are given an integer array nums. In one move, you can pick an index i where 0 <= i < nums.length and increment nums[i] by 1.\nReturn the minimum number of moves to make every value in nums unique.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [1,2,2]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: After 1 move, the array could be [1, 2, 3].\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [3,2,1,2,1,7]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: After 6 moves, the array could be [3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 7].\nIt can be shown with 5 or less moves that it is impossible for the array to have all unique values.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 105\n0 <= nums[i] <= 105\n\n'

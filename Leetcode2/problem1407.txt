b'You are given an array items, where each items[i] = [typei, colori, namei] describes the type, color, and name of the ith item. You are also given a rule represented by two strings, ruleKey and ruleValue.\nThe ith item is said to match the rule if one of the following is true:\n\nruleKey == "type" and ruleValue == typei.\nruleKey == "color" and ruleValue == colori.\nruleKey == "name" and ruleValue == namei.\n\nReturn the number of items that match the given rule.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","lenovo"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "color", ruleValue = "silver"\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: There is only one item matching the given rule, which is ["computer","silver","lenovo"].\n\nExample 2:\nInput: items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","phone"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "type", ruleValue = "phone"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: There are only two items matching the given rule, which are ["phone","blue","pixel"] and ["phone","gold","iphone"]. Note that the item ["computer","silver","phone"] does not match.\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= items.length <= 104\n1 <= typei.length, colori.length, namei.length, ruleValue.length <= 10\nruleKey is equal to either "type", "color", or "name".\nAll strings consist only of lowercase letters.\n\n'

b'Given an integer array nums where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree.\nA height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [-10,-3,0,5,9]\nOutput: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]\nExplanation: [0,-10,5,null,-3,null,9] is also accepted:\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,3]\nOutput: [3,1]\nExplanation: [1,null,3] and [3,1] are both height-balanced BSTs.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 104\n-104 <= nums[i] <= 104\nnums is sorted in a strictly increasing order.\n\n'

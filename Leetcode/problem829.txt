b'Given the root of a binary tree with unique values and the values of two different nodes of the tree x and y, return true if the nodes corresponding to the values x and y in the tree are cousins, or false otherwise.\nTwo nodes of a binary tree are cousins if they have the same depth with different parents.\nNote that in a binary tree, the root node is at the depth 0, and children of each depth k node are at the depth k + 1.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [1,2,3,4], x = 4, y = 3\nOutput: false\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [1,2,3,null,4,null,5], x = 5, y = 4\nOutput: true\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: root = [1,2,3,null,4], x = 2, y = 3\nOutput: false\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 100].\n1 <= Node.val <= 100\nEach node has a unique value.\nx != y\nx and y are exist in the tree.\n\n'

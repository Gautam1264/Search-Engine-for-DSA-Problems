b'In a deck of cards, each card has an integer written on it.\nReturn true if and only if you can choose X >= 2 such that it is possible to split the entire deck into 1 or more groups of cards, where:\n\nEach group has exactly X cards.\nAll the cards in each group have the same integer.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: deck = [1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Possible partition [1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4].\n\nExample 2:\nInput: deck = [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: No possible partition.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= deck.length <= 104\n0 <= deck[i] < 104\n\n'

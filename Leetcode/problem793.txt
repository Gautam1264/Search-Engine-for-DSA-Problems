b"There are 8 prison cells in a row and each cell is either occupied or vacant.\nEach day, whether the cell is occupied or vacant changes according to the following rules:\n\nIf a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant, then the cell becomes occupied.\nOtherwise, it becomes vacant.\n\nNote that because the prison is a row, the first and the last cells in the row can't have two adjacent neighbors.\nYou are given an integer array cells where cells[i] == 1 if the ith cell is occupied and cells[i] == 0 if the ith cell is vacant, and you are given an integer n.\nReturn the state of the prison after n days (i.e., n such changes described above).\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: cells = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1], n = 7\nOutput: [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]\nExplanation: The following table summarizes the state of the prison on each day:\nDay 0: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\nDay 1: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nDay 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nDay 3: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nDay 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nDay 5: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nDay 6: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]\nDay 7: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample 2:\nInput: cells = [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0], n = 1000000000\nOutput: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\ncells.length == 8\ncells[i]\xc2\xa0is either 0 or 1.\n1 <= n <= 109\n\n"

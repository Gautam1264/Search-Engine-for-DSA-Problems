b'Given the root of a binary tree, construct a string consisting of parenthesis and integers from a binary tree with the preorder traversal way, and return it.\nOmit all the empty parenthesis pairs that do not affect the one-to-one mapping relationship between the string and the original binary tree.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [1,2,3,4]\nOutput: "1(2(4))(3)"\nExplanation: Originally, it needs to be "1(2(4)())(3()())", but you need to omit all the unnecessary empty parenthesis pairs. And it will be "1(2(4))(3)"\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [1,2,3,null,4]\nOutput: "1(2()(4))(3)"\nExplanation: Almost the same as the first example, except we cannot omit the first parenthesis pair to break the one-to-one mapping relationship between the input and the output.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].\n-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000\n\n'

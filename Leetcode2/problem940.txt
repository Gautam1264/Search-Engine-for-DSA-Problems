b'You are given a string text. You can swap two of the characters in the text.\nReturn the length of the longest substring with repeated characters.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: text = "ababa"\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: We can swap the first \'b\' with the last \'a\', or the last \'b\' with the first \'a\'. Then, the longest repeated character substring is "aaa" with length 3.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: text = "aaabaaa"\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: Swap \'b\' with the last \'a\' (or the first \'a\'), and we get longest repeated character substring "aaaaaa" with length 6.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: text = "aaaaa"\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: No need to swap, longest repeated character substring is "aaaaa" with length is 5.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= text.length <= 2 * 104\ntext consist of lowercase English characters only.\n\n'

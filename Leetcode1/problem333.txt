b'Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of all left leaves.\nA leaf is a node with no children. A left leaf is a leaf that is the left child of another node.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]\nOutput: 24\nExplanation: There are two left leaves in the binary tree, with values 9 and 15 respectively.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: root = [1]\nOutput: 0\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].\n-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000\n\n'

b'Given an array\xc2\xa0of intervals\xc2\xa0where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]\nOutput: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]\nExplanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].\n\nExample 2:\nInput: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]\nOutput: [[1,5]]\nExplanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= intervals.length <= 104\nintervals[i].length == 2\n0 <= starti <= endi <= 104\n\n'

b'Given a list of words, list of\xc2\xa0 single\xc2\xa0letters (might be repeating)\xc2\xa0and score\xc2\xa0of every character.\nReturn the maximum score of any valid set of words formed by using the given letters (words[i] cannot be used two\xc2\xa0or more times).\nIt is not necessary to use all characters in letters and each letter can only be used once. Score of letters\xc2\xa0\'a\', \'b\', \'c\', ... ,\'z\' is given by\xc2\xa0score[0], score[1], ... , score[25] respectively.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: words = ["dog","cat","dad","good"], letters = ["a","a","c","d","d","d","g","o","o"], score = [1,0,9,5,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nOutput: 23\nExplanation:\nScore  a=1, c=9, d=5, g=3, o=2\nGiven letters, we can form the words "dad" (5+1+5) and "good" (3+2+2+5) with a score of 23.\nWords "dad" and "dog" only get a score of 21.\nExample 2:\nInput: words = ["xxxz","ax","bx","cx"], letters = ["z","a","b","c","x","x","x"], score = [4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,10]\nOutput: 27\nExplanation:\nScore  a=4, b=4, c=4, x=5, z=10\nGiven letters, we can form the words "ax" (4+5), "bx" (4+5) and "cx" (4+5) with a score of 27.\nWord "xxxz" only get a score of 25.\nExample 3:\nInput: words = ["leetcode"], letters = ["l","e","t","c","o","d"], score = [0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation:\nLetter "e" can only be used once.\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= words.length <= 14\n1 <= words[i].length <= 15\n1 <= letters.length <= 100\nletters[i].length == 1\nscore.length ==\xc2\xa026\n0 <= score[i] <= 10\nwords[i], letters[i]\xc2\xa0contains only lower case English letters.\n\n'

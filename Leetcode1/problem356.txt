b"Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= intervals.length <= 105\nintervals[i].length == 2\n-5 * 104 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 104\n\n"

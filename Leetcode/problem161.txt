b'Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.\nReturn the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.\nThe tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.\nYour solution must use only constant extra space.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9\nOutput: [1,2]\nExplanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].\n\nExample 2:\nInput: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6\nOutput: [1,3]\nExplanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].\n\nExample 3:\nInput: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1\nOutput: [1,2]\nExplanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104\n-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000\nnumbers is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n-1000 <= target <= 1000\nThe tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.\n\n'

b"Given a binary array nums, you should delete one element from it.\nReturn the size of the longest non-empty subarray containing only 1's in the resulting array. Return 0 if there is no such subarray.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [1,1,0,1]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: After deleting the number in position 2, [1,1,1] contains 3 numbers with value of 1's.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1]\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: After deleting the number in position 4, [0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1] longest subarray with value of 1's is [1,1,1,1,1].\n\nExample 3:\nInput: nums = [1,1,1]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: You must delete one element.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 105\nnums[i] is either 0 or 1.\n\n"

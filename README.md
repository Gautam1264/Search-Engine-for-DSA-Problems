# Search-Engine-for-DSA-Problems
Implemented search engine for DSA problems

Used BM-25 algorithm to score the questions in the database and display the best 10 possible results.

Technologies Used -    
    
Fontend - HTML , CSS , JAVASCRIPT   
backend - MONGO-DB , NODE-JS , EXPRESS-JS
      
           
  
To run this in your computer , you need to first install node in your computer.  
Then you have to run node commands. ( node init )   
After that, you have to install some packages using npm which are listed in package.json file.  
   
I have listed them below with their versions -    
"ejs": "^3.1.7",   
"express": "^4.18.1",   
"line-reader": "^0.4.0",  
"lodash": "^4.17.21",   
"mongoose": "^6.3.3",   
"morgan": "^1.10.0",   
"number-to-words": "^1.2.4",   
"remove-punctuation": "^0.0.4",   
"spellchecker": "^3.7.1",   
"stopword": "^2.0.2"   
    
   
Then you can use "nodemon" to run your server.

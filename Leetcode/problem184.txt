b"Write a bash script to calculate the frequency of each word in a text file words.txt.\nFor simplicity sake, you may assume:\n\nwords.txt contains only lowercase characters and space ' ' characters.\nEach word must consist of lowercase characters only.\nWords are separated by one or more whitespace characters.\n\nExample:\nAssume that words.txt has the following content:\nthe day is sunny the the\nthe sunny is is\n\nYour script should output the following, sorted by descending frequency:\nthe 4\nis 3\nsunny 2\nday 1\n\nNote:\n\nDon't worry about handling ties, it is guaranteed that each word's frequency count is unique.\nCould you write it in one-line using Unix pipes?\n\n"

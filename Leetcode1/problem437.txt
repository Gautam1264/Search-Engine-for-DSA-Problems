b'Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), return the minimum absolute difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [4,2,6,1,3]\nOutput: 1\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [1,0,48,null,null,12,49]\nOutput: 1\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 104].\n0 <= Node.val <= 105\n\n\xc2\xa0\nNote: This question is the same as 783: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-distance-between-bst-nodes/\n'

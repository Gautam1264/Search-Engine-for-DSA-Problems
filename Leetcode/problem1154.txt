b"Given two integer arrays startTime and endTime and given an integer queryTime.\nThe ith student started doing their homework at the time startTime[i] and finished it at time endTime[i].\nReturn the number of students doing their homework at time queryTime. More formally, return the number of students where queryTime lays in the interval [startTime[i], endTime[i]] inclusive.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: startTime = [1,2,3], endTime = [3,2,7], queryTime = 4\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: We have 3 students where:\nThe first student started doing homework at time 1 and finished at time 3 and wasn't doing anything at time 4.\nThe second student started doing homework at time 2 and finished at time 2 and also wasn't doing anything at time 4.\nThe third student started doing homework at time 3 and finished at time 7 and was the only student doing homework at time 4.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: startTime = [4], endTime = [4], queryTime = 4\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: The only student was doing their homework at the queryTime.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nstartTime.length == endTime.length\n1 <= startTime.length <= 100\n1 <= startTime[i] <= endTime[i] <= 1000\n1 <= queryTime <= 1000\n\n"

b'You are given an integer array nums that is sorted in non-decreasing order.\nDetermine if it is possible to split nums into one or more subsequences such that both of the following conditions are true:\n\nEach subsequence is a consecutive increasing sequence (i.e. each integer is exactly one more than the previous integer).\nAll subsequences have a length of 3 or more.\n\nReturn true if you can split nums according to the above conditions, or false otherwise.\nA subsequence of an array is a new array that is formed from the original array by deleting some (can be none) of the elements without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining elements. (i.e., [1,3,5] is a subsequence of [1,2,3,4,5] while [1,3,2] is not).\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,3,4,5]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: nums can be split into the following subsequences:\n[1,2,3,3,4,5] --> 1, 2, 3\n[1,2,3,3,4,5] --> 3, 4, 5\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: nums can be split into the following subsequences:\n[1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5] --> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n[1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5] --> 3, 4, 5\n\nExample 3:\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4,4,5]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: It is impossible to split nums into consecutive increasing subsequences of length 3 or more.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 104\n-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000\nnums is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n'

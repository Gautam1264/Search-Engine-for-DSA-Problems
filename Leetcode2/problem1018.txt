b'Given an n x n integer matrix grid, return the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts.\nA falling path with non-zero shifts is a choice of exactly one element from each row of grid such that no two elements chosen in adjacent rows are in the same column.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: arr = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]\nOutput: 13\nExplanation: \nThe possible falling paths are:\n[1,5,9], [1,5,7], [1,6,7], [1,6,8],\n[2,4,8], [2,4,9], [2,6,7], [2,6,8],\n[3,4,8], [3,4,9], [3,5,7], [3,5,9]\nThe falling path with the smallest sum is\xc2\xa0[1,5,7], so the answer is\xc2\xa013.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: grid = [[7]]\nOutput: 7\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nn == grid.length == grid[i].length\n1 <= n <= 200\n-99 <= grid[i][j] <= 99\n\n'

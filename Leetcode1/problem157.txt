b'A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.\nGiven an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If\xc2\xa0the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.\nYou may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -\xe2\x88\x9e.\nYou must write an algorithm that runs in\xc2\xa0O(log n) time.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,1]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 1000\n-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1\nnums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.\n\n'

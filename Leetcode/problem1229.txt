b'Given two positive integers n and k, the binary string Sn is formed as follows:\n\nS1 = "0"\nSi = Si - 1 + "1" + reverse(invert(Si - 1)) for i > 1\n\nWhere + denotes the concatenation operation, reverse(x) returns the reversed string x, and invert(x) inverts all the bits in x (0 changes to 1 and 1 changes to 0).\nFor example, the first four strings in the above sequence are:\n\nS1 = "0"\nS2 = "011"\nS3 = "0111001"\nS4 = "011100110110001"\n\nReturn the kth bit in Sn. It is guaranteed that k is valid for the given n.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 3, k = 1\nOutput: "0"\nExplanation: S3 is "0111001".\nThe 1st bit is "0".\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 4, k = 11\nOutput: "1"\nExplanation: S4 is "011100110110001".\nThe 11th bit is "1".\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 20\n1 <= k <= 2n - 1\n\n'

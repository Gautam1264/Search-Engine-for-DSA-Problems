b'Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.\nNote that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".\nNote that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]\nOutput: false\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 300\n1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000\n1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 20\ns and wordDict[i] consist of only lowercase English letters.\nAll the strings of wordDict are unique.\n\n'

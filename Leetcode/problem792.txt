b'You are installing a billboard and want it to have the largest height. The billboard will have two steel supports, one on each side. Each steel support must be an equal height.\nYou are given a collection of rods that can be welded together. For example, if you have rods of lengths 1, 2, and 3, you can weld them together to make a support of length 6.\nReturn the largest possible height of your billboard installation. If you cannot support the billboard, return 0.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: rods = [1,2,3,6]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: We have two disjoint subsets {1,2,3} and {6}, which have the same sum = 6.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: rods = [1,2,3,4,5,6]\nOutput: 10\nExplanation: We have two disjoint subsets {2,3,5} and {4,6}, which have the same sum = 10.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: rods = [1,2]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: The billboard cannot be supported, so we return 0.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= rods.length <= 20\n1 <= rods[i] <= 1000\nsum(rods[i]) <= 5000\n\n'

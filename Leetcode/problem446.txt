b'Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.\nThe diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.\nThe length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [1,2,3,4,5]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].\n\nExample 2:\nInput: root = [1,2]\nOutput: 1\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].\n-100 <= Node.val <= 100\n\n'

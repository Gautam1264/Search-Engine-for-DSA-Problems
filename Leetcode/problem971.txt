b'You are given a string s and an integer k, a k duplicate removal consists of choosing k adjacent and equal letters from s and removing them, causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.\nWe repeatedly make k duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.\nReturn the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "abcd", k = 2\nOutput: "abcd"\nExplanation: There\'s nothing to delete.\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3\nOutput: "aa"\nExplanation: \nFirst delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa"\nThen delete "bbb", get "dddaa"\nFinally delete "ddd", get "aa"\nExample 3:\nInput: s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2\nOutput: "ps"\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 105\n2 <= k <= 104\ns only contains lower case English letters.\n\n'

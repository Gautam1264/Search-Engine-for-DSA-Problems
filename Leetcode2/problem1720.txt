b'You are given an integer finalSum. Split it into a sum of a maximum number of unique positive even integers.\n\nFor example, given finalSum = 12, the following splits are valid (unique positive even integers summing up to finalSum): (12), (2 + 10), (2 + 4 + 6), and (4 + 8). Among them, (2 + 4 + 6) contains the maximum number of integers. Note that finalSum cannot be split into (2 + 2 + 4 + 4) as all the numbers should be unique.\n\nReturn a list of integers that represent a valid split containing a maximum number of integers. If no valid split exists for finalSum, return an empty list. You may return the integers in any order.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: finalSum = 12\nOutput: [2,4,6]\nExplanation: The following are valid splits: (12), (2 + 10), (2 + 4 + 6), and (4 + 8).\n(2 + 4 + 6) has the maximum number of integers, which is 3. Thus, we return [2,4,6].\nNote that [2,6,4], [6,2,4], etc. are also accepted.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: finalSum = 7\nOutput: []\nExplanation: There are no valid splits for the given finalSum.\nThus, we return an empty array.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: finalSum = 28\nOutput: [6,8,2,12]\nExplanation: The following are valid splits: (2 + 26), (6 + 8 + 2 + 12), and (4 + 24). \n(6 + 8 + 2 + 12) has the maximum number of integers, which is 4. Thus, we return [6,8,2,12].\nNote that [10,2,4,12], [6,2,4,16], etc. are also accepted.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= finalSum <= 1010\n\n'

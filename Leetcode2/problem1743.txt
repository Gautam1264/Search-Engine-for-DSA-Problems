b'You are given a 0-indexed string text and another 0-indexed string pattern of length 2, both of which consist of only lowercase English letters.\nYou can add either pattern[0] or pattern[1] anywhere in text exactly once. Note that the character can be added even at the beginning or at the end of text.\nReturn the maximum number of times pattern can occur as a subsequence of the modified text.\nA subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: text = "abdcdbc", pattern = "ac"\nOutput: 4\nExplanation:\nIf we add pattern[0] = \'a\' in between text[1] and text[2], we get "abadcdbc". Now, the number of times "ac" occurs as a subsequence is 4.\nSome other strings which have 4 subsequences "ac" after adding a character to text are "aabdcdbc" and "abdacdbc".\nHowever, strings such as "abdcadbc", "abdccdbc", and "abdcdbcc", although obtainable, have only 3 subsequences "ac" and are thus suboptimal.\nIt can be shown that it is not possible to get more than 4 subsequences "ac" by adding only one character.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: text = "aabb", pattern = "ab"\nOutput: 6\nExplanation:\nSome of the strings which can be obtained from text and have 6 subsequences "ab" are "aaabb", "aaabb", and "aabbb".\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= text.length <= 105\npattern.length == 2\ntext and pattern consist only of lowercase English letters.\n\n'

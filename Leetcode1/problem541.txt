b'In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.\nYou are given a graph that started as a tree with n nodes labeled from 1 to n, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to n, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array edges of length n where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.\nReturn an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of n nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]\nOutput: [2,3]\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4],[1,5]]\nOutput: [1,4]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nn == edges.length\n3 <= n <= 1000\nedges[i].length == 2\n1 <= ai < bi <= edges.length\nai != bi\nThere are no repeated edges.\nThe given graph is connected.\n\n'

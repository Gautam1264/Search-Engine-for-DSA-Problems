b'You are given a 0-indexed binary string s and two integers minJump and maxJump. In the beginning, you are standing at index 0, which is equal to \'0\'. You can move from index i to index j if the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\ni + minJump <= j <= min(i + maxJump, s.length - 1), and\ns[j] == \'0\'.\n\nReturn true if you can reach index s.length - 1 in s, or false otherwise.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "011010", minJump = 2, maxJump = 3\nOutput: true\nExplanation:\nIn the first step, move from index 0 to index 3. \nIn the second step, move from index 3 to index 5.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "01101110", minJump = 2, maxJump = 3\nOutput: false\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= s.length <= 105\ns[i] is either \'0\' or \'1\'.\ns[0] == \'0\'\n1 <= minJump <= maxJump < s.length\n\n'

b'You are given a 2D integer array intervals, where intervals[i] = [lefti, righti] describes the ith interval starting at lefti and ending at righti (inclusive). The size of an interval is defined as the number of integers it contains, or more formally righti - lefti + 1.\nYou are also given an integer array queries. The answer to the jth query is the size of the smallest interval i such that lefti <= queries[j] <= righti. If no such interval exists, the answer is -1.\nReturn an array containing the answers to the queries.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: intervals = [[1,4],[2,4],[3,6],[4,4]], queries = [2,3,4,5]\nOutput: [3,3,1,4]\nExplanation: The queries are processed as follows:\n- Query = 2: The interval [2,4] is the smallest interval containing 2. The answer is 4 - 2 + 1 = 3.\n- Query = 3: The interval [2,4] is the smallest interval containing 3. The answer is 4 - 2 + 1 = 3.\n- Query = 4: The interval [4,4] is the smallest interval containing 4. The answer is 4 - 4 + 1 = 1.\n- Query = 5: The interval [3,6] is the smallest interval containing 5. The answer is 6 - 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: intervals = [[2,3],[2,5],[1,8],[20,25]], queries = [2,19,5,22]\nOutput: [2,-1,4,6]\nExplanation: The queries are processed as follows:\n- Query = 2: The interval [2,3] is the smallest interval containing 2. The answer is 3 - 2 + 1 = 2.\n- Query = 19: None of the intervals contain 19. The answer is -1.\n- Query = 5: The interval [2,5] is the smallest interval containing 5. The answer is 5 - 2 + 1 = 4.\n- Query = 22: The interval [20,25] is the smallest interval containing 22. The answer is 25 - 20 + 1 = 6.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= intervals.length <= 105\n1 <= queries.length <= 105\nintervals[i].length == 2\n1 <= lefti <= righti <= 107\n1 <= queries[j] <= 107\n\n'

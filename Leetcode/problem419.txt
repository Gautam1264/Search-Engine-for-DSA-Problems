b'The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,\nF(0) = 0, F(1) = 1\nF(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.\n\nGiven n, calculate F(n).\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 2\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 3\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: n = 4\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n0 <= n <= 30\n\n'

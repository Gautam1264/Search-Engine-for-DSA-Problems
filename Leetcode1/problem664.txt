b'Let\'s define a function countUniqueChars(s) that returns the number of unique characters on s.\n\nFor example, calling countUniqueChars(s) if s = "LEETCODE" then "L", "T", "C", "O", "D" are the unique characters since they appear only once in s, therefore countUniqueChars(s) = 5.\n\nGiven a string s, return the sum of countUniqueChars(t) where t is a substring of s.\nNotice that some substrings can be repeated so in this case you have to count the repeated ones too.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "ABC"\nOutput: 10\nExplanation: All possible substrings are: "A","B","C","AB","BC" and "ABC".\nEvery substring is composed with only unique letters.\nSum of lengths of all substring is 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 10\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "ABA"\nOutput: 8\nExplanation: The same as example 1, except countUniqueChars("ABA") = 1.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s = "LEETCODE"\nOutput: 92\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 105\ns consists of uppercase English letters only.\n\n'

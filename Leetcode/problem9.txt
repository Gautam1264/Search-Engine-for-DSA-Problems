b'Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.\nAn integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.\n\nFor example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: x = 121\nOutput: true\nExplanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: x = -121\nOutput: false\nExplanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: x = 10\nOutput: false\nExplanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n-231\xc2\xa0<= x <= 231\xc2\xa0- 1\n\n\xc2\xa0\nFollow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?'

b'You are given a license key represented as a string s that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes. The string is separated into n + 1 groups by n dashes. You are also given an integer k.\nWe want to reformat the string s such that each group contains exactly k characters, except for the first group, which could be shorter than k but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups, and you should convert all lowercase letters to uppercase.\nReturn the reformatted license key.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", k = 4\nOutput: "5F3Z-2E9W"\nExplanation: The string s has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.\nNote that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "2-5g-3-J", k = 2\nOutput: "2-5G-3J"\nExplanation: The string s has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 105\ns consists of English letters, digits, and dashes \'-\'.\n1 <= k <= 104\n\n'

b'There are n people and 40 types of hats labeled from 1 to 40.\nGiven a 2D integer array hats, where hats[i] is a list of all hats preferred by the ith person.\nReturn the number of ways that the n people wear different hats to each other.\nSince the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: hats = [[3,4],[4,5],[5]]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: There is only one way to choose hats given the conditions. \nFirst person choose hat 3, Second person choose hat 4 and last one hat 5.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: hats = [[3,5,1],[3,5]]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: There are 4 ways to choose hats:\n(3,5), (5,3), (1,3) and (1,5)\n\nExample 3:\nInput: hats = [[1,2,3,4],[1,2,3,4],[1,2,3,4],[1,2,3,4]]\nOutput: 24\nExplanation: Each person can choose hats labeled from 1 to 4.\nNumber of Permutations of (1,2,3,4) = 24.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nn == hats.length\n1 <= n <= 10\n1 <= hats[i].length <= 40\n1 <= hats[i][j] <= 40\nhats[i] contains a list of unique integers.\n\n'

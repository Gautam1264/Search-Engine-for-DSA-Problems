b'A happy string is a string that:\n\nconsists only of letters of the set [\'a\', \'b\', \'c\'].\ns[i] != s[i + 1] for all values of i from 1 to s.length - 1 (string is 1-indexed).\n\nFor example, strings "abc", "ac", "b" and "abcbabcbcb" are all happy strings and strings "aa", "baa" and "ababbc" are not happy strings.\nGiven two integers n and k, consider a list of all happy strings of length n sorted in lexicographical order.\nReturn the kth string of this list or return an empty string if there are less than k happy strings of length n.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 1, k = 3\nOutput: "c"\nExplanation: The list ["a", "b", "c"] contains all happy strings of length 1. The third string is "c".\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 1, k = 4\nOutput: ""\nExplanation: There are only 3 happy strings of length 1.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: n = 3, k = 9\nOutput: "cab"\nExplanation: There are 12 different happy string of length 3 ["aba", "abc", "aca", "acb", "bab", "bac", "bca", "bcb", "cab", "cac", "cba", "cbc"]. You will find the 9th string = "cab"\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 10\n1 <= k <= 100\n\n'

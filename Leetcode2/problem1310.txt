b'You have a bomb to defuse, and your time is running out! Your informer will provide you with a circular array code\xc2\xa0of length of n\xc2\xa0and a key k.\nTo decrypt the code, you must replace every number. All the numbers are replaced simultaneously.\n\nIf k > 0, replace the ith number with the sum of the next k numbers.\nIf k < 0, replace the ith number with the sum of the previous k numbers.\nIf k == 0, replace the ith number with 0.\n\nAs code is circular, the next element of code[n-1] is code[0], and the previous element of code[0] is code[n-1].\nGiven the circular array code and an integer key k, return the decrypted code to defuse the bomb!\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: code = [5,7,1,4], k = 3\nOutput: [12,10,16,13]\nExplanation: Each number is replaced by the sum of the next 3 numbers. The decrypted code is [7+1+4, 1+4+5, 4+5+7, 5+7+1]. Notice that the numbers wrap around.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: code = [1,2,3,4], k = 0\nOutput: [0,0,0,0]\nExplanation: When k is zero, the numbers are replaced by 0. \n\nExample 3:\nInput: code = [2,4,9,3], k = -2\nOutput: [12,5,6,13]\nExplanation: The decrypted code is [3+9, 2+3, 4+2, 9+4]. Notice that the numbers wrap around again. If k is negative, the sum is of the previous numbers.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nn == code.length\n1 <= n\xc2\xa0<= 100\n1 <= code[i] <= 100\n-(n - 1) <= k <= n - 1\n\n'

b'You are given two integer arrays nums and multipliers of size n and m respectively, where n >= m. The arrays are 1-indexed.\nYou begin with a score of 0. You want to perform exactly m operations. On the ith operation (1-indexed), you will:\n\nChoose one integer x from either the start or the end of the array nums.\nAdd multipliers[i] * x to your score.\nRemove x from the array nums.\n\nReturn the maximum score after performing m operations.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [1,2,3], multipliers = [3,2,1]\nOutput: 14\nExplanation:\xc2\xa0An optimal solution is as follows:\n- Choose from the end, [1,2,3], adding 3 * 3 = 9 to the score.\n- Choose from the end, [1,2], adding 2 * 2 = 4 to the score.\n- Choose from the end, [1], adding 1 * 1 = 1 to the score.\nThe total score is 9 + 4 + 1 = 14.\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [-5,-3,-3,-2,7,1], multipliers = [-10,-5,3,4,6]\nOutput: 102\nExplanation: An optimal solution is as follows:\n- Choose from the start, [-5,-3,-3,-2,7,1], adding -5 * -10 = 50 to the score.\n- Choose from the start, [-3,-3,-2,7,1], adding -3 * -5 = 15 to the score.\n- Choose from the start, [-3,-2,7,1], adding -3 * 3 = -9 to the score.\n- Choose from the end, [-2,7,1], adding 1 * 4 = 4 to the score.\n- Choose from the end, [-2,7], adding 7 * 6 = 42 to the score. \nThe total score is 50 + 15 - 9 + 4 + 42 = 102.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nn == nums.length\nm == multipliers.length\n1 <= m <= 103\nm <= n <= 105 \n-1000 <= nums[i], multipliers[i] <= 1000\n\n'

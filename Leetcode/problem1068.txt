b'You are given two strings of the same length s and t. In one step you can choose any character of t and replace it with another character.\nReturn the minimum number of steps to make t an anagram of s.\nAn Anagram of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "bab", t = "aba"\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: Replace the first \'a\' in t with b, t = "bba" which is anagram of s.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "leetcode", t = "practice"\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: Replace \'p\', \'r\', \'a\', \'i\' and \'c\' from t with proper characters to make t anagram of s.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s = "anagram", t = "mangaar"\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: "anagram" and "mangaar" are anagrams. \n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104\ns.length == t.length\ns and t consist of lowercase English letters only.\n\n'

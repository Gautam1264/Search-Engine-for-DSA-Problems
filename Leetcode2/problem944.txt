b'Given the root of a binary tree, the level of its root is 1, the level of its children is 2, and so on.\nReturn the smallest level x such that the sum of all the values of nodes at level x is maximal.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [1,7,0,7,-8,null,null]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: \nLevel 1 sum = 1.\nLevel 2 sum = 7 + 0 = 7.\nLevel 3 sum = 7 + -8 = -1.\nSo we return the level with the maximum sum which is level 2.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: root = [989,null,10250,98693,-89388,null,null,null,-32127]\nOutput: 2\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].\n-105 <= Node.val <= 105\n\n'

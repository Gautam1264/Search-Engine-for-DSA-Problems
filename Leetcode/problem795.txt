b'An n x n grid is composed of 1 x 1 squares where each 1 x 1 square consists of a \'/\', \'\\\', or blank space \' \'. These characters divide the square into contiguous regions.\nGiven the grid grid represented as a string array, return the number of regions.\nNote that backslash characters are escaped, so a \'\\\' is represented as \'\\\\\'.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: grid = [" /","/ "]\nOutput: 2\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: grid = [" /","  "]\nOutput: 1\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: grid = ["/\\\\","\\\\/"]\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: Recall that because \\ characters are escaped, "\\\\/" refers to \\/, and "/\\\\" refers to /\\.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nn == grid.length == grid[i].length\n1 <= n <= 30\ngrid[i][j] is either \'/\', \'\\\', or \' \'.\n\n'

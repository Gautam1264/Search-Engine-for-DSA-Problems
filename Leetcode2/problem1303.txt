b'Given an integer n, return the number of strings of length n that consist only of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and are lexicographically sorted.\nA string s is lexicographically sorted if for all valid i, s[i] is the same as or comes before s[i+1] in the alphabet.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 1\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: The 5 sorted strings that consist of vowels only are ["a","e","i","o","u"].\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 2\nOutput: 15\nExplanation: The 15 sorted strings that consist of vowels only are\n["aa","ae","ai","ao","au","ee","ei","eo","eu","ii","io","iu","oo","ou","uu"].\nNote that "ea" is not a valid string since \'e\' comes after \'a\' in the alphabet.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: n = 33\nOutput: 66045\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 50\xc2\xa0\n\n'

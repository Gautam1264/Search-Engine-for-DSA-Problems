b'Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.\nYou must write an algorithm that runs in\xc2\xa0O(n)\xc2\xa0time.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]\nOutput: 9\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n0 <= nums.length <= 105\n-109 <= nums[i] <= 109\n\n'

b'You are given an array nums of non-negative integers. nums is considered special if there exists a number x such that there are exactly x numbers in nums that are greater than or equal to x.\nNotice that x does not have to be an element in nums.\nReturn x if the array is special, otherwise, return -1. It can be proven that if nums is special, the value for x is unique.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [3,5]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: There are 2 values (3 and 5) that are greater than or equal to 2.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [0,0]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: No numbers fit the criteria for x.\nIf x = 0, there should be 0 numbers >= x, but there are 2.\nIf x = 1, there should be 1 number >= x, but there are 0.\nIf x = 2, there should be 2 numbers >= x, but there are 0.\nx cannot be greater since there are only 2 numbers in nums.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: nums = [0,4,3,0,4]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: There are 3 values that are greater than or equal to 3.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 100\n0 <= nums[i] <= 1000\n\n'

b'Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value target in an m x n integer matrix matrix. This matrix has the following properties:\n\nIntegers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.\nIntegers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 5\nOutput: true\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 20\nOutput: false\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nm == matrix.length\nn == matrix[i].length\n1 <= n, m <= 300\n-109 <= matrix[i][j] <= 109\nAll the integers in each row are sorted in ascending order.\nAll the integers in each column are sorted in ascending order.\n-109 <= target <= 109\n\n'

b'Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked list sorted as well.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]\nOutput: [1,2,5]\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: head = [1,1,1,2,3]\nOutput: [2,3]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].\n-100 <= Node.val <= 100\nThe list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.\n\n'

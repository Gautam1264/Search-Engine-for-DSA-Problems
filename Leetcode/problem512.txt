b'In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other word to form another longer word - let\'s call this word successor. For example, when the root "an" is followed by the successor word "other", we can form a new word "another".\nGiven a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence consisting of words separated by spaces, replace all the successors in the sentence with the root forming it. If a successor can be replaced by more than one root, replace it with the root that has the shortest length.\nReturn the sentence after the replacement.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: dictionary = ["cat","bat","rat"], sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"\nOutput: "the cat was rat by the bat"\n\nExample 2:\nInput: dictionary = ["a","b","c"], sentence = "aadsfasf absbs bbab cadsfafs"\nOutput: "a a b c"\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= dictionary.length <= 1000\n1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 100\ndictionary[i] consists of only lower-case letters.\n1 <= sentence.length <= 106\nsentence consists of only lower-case letters and spaces.\nThe number of words in sentence is in the range [1, 1000]\nThe length of each word in sentence is in the range [1, 1000]\nEvery two consecutive words in sentence will be separated by exactly one space.\nsentence does not have leading or trailing spaces.\n\n'

b"You are given an array target of n integers. From a starting array arr consisting of n 1's, you may perform the following procedure :\n\nlet x be the sum of all elements currently in your array.\nchoose index i, such that 0 <= i < n and set the value of arr at index i to x.\nYou may repeat this procedure as many times as needed.\n\nReturn true if it is possible to construct the target array from arr, otherwise, return false.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: target = [9,3,5]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Start with arr = [1, 1, 1] \n[1, 1, 1], sum = 3 choose index 1\n[1, 3, 1], sum = 5 choose index 2\n[1, 3, 5], sum = 9 choose index 0\n[9, 3, 5] Done\n\nExample 2:\nInput: target = [1,1,1,2]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: Impossible to create target array from [1,1,1,1].\n\nExample 3:\nInput: target = [8,5]\nOutput: true\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nn == target.length\n1 <= n <= 5 * 104\n1 <= target[i] <= 109\n\n"

b'Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p\'s anagrams in s. You may return the answer in any order.\nAn Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"\nOutput: [0,6]\nExplanation:\nThe substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".\nThe substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "abab", p = "ab"\nOutput: [0,1,2]\nExplanation:\nThe substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".\nThe substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".\nThe substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 104\ns and p consist of lowercase English letters.\n\n'

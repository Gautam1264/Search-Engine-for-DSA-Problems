b'Given the following details of a matrix with n columns and 2 rows :\n\nThe matrix is a binary matrix, which means each element in the matrix can be 0 or 1.\nThe sum of elements of the 0-th(upper) row is given as upper.\nThe sum of elements of the 1-st(lower) row is given as lower.\nThe sum of elements in the i-th column(0-indexed) is colsum[i], where colsum is given as an integer array with length n.\n\nYour task is to reconstruct the matrix with upper, lower and colsum.\nReturn it as a 2-D integer array.\nIf there are more than one valid solution, any of them will be accepted.\nIf no valid solution exists, return an empty 2-D array.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: upper = 2, lower = 1, colsum = [1,1,1]\nOutput: [[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]\nExplanation: [[1,0,1],[0,1,0]], and [[0,1,1],[1,0,0]] are also correct answers.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: upper = 2, lower = 3, colsum = [2,2,1,1]\nOutput: []\n\nExample 3:\nInput: upper = 5, lower = 5, colsum = [2,1,2,0,1,0,1,2,0,1]\nOutput: [[1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0],[1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1]]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= colsum.length <= 10^5\n0 <= upper, lower <= colsum.length\n0 <= colsum[i] <= 2\n\n'

b'Given string num representing a non-negative integer num, and an integer k, return the smallest possible integer after removing k digits from num.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: num = "1432219", k = 3\nOutput: "1219"\nExplanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: num = "10200", k = 1\nOutput: "200"\nExplanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: num = "10", k = 2\nOutput: "0"\nExplanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= k <= num.length <= 105\nnum consists of only digits.\nnum does not have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.\n\n'

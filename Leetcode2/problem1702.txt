b'You are given an array of integers nums. You are also given an integer original which is the first number that needs to be searched for in nums.\nYou then do the following steps:\n\nIf original is found in nums, multiply it by two (i.e., set original = 2 * original).\nOtherwise, stop the process.\nRepeat this process with the new number as long as you keep finding the number.\n\nReturn the final value of original.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [5,3,6,1,12], original = 3\nOutput: 24\nExplanation: \n- 3 is found in nums. 3 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 6.\n- 6 is found in nums. 6 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 12.\n- 12 is found in nums. 12 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 24.\n- 24 is not found in nums. Thus, 24 is returned.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [2,7,9], original = 4\nOutput: 4\nExplanation:\n- 4 is not found in nums. Thus, 4 is returned.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 1000\n1 <= nums[i], original <= 1000\n\n'

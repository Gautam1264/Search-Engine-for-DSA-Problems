b'Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring of s such that the frequency of each character in this substring is greater than or equal to k.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "aaabb", k = 3\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The longest substring is "aaa", as \'a\' is repeated 3 times.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "ababbc", k = 2\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: The longest substring is "ababb", as \'a\' is repeated 2 times and \'b\' is repeated 3 times.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 104\ns consists of only lowercase English letters.\n1 <= k <= 105\n\n'

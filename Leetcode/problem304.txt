b'We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:\nI pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.\nEvery time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.\nYou call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:\n\n-1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).\n1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).\n0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).\n\nReturn the number that I picked.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 10, pick = 6\nOutput: 6\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 1, pick = 1\nOutput: 1\n\nExample 3:\nInput: n = 2, pick = 1\nOutput: 1\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 231 - 1\n1 <= pick <= n\n\n'

b'The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as \'A\', \'C\', \'G\', and \'T\'.\n\nFor example, "ACGAATTCCG" is a DNA sequence.\n\nWhen studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.\nGiven a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in any order.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"\nOutput: ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA"\nOutput: ["AAAAAAAAAA"]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 105\ns[i] is either \'A\', \'C\', \'G\', or \'T\'.\n\n'

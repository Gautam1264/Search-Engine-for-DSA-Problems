b'Given an integer array nums, your goal is to make all elements in nums equal. To complete one operation, follow these steps:\n\nFind the largest value in nums. Let its index be i (0-indexed) and its value be largest. If there are multiple elements with the largest value, pick the smallest i.\nFind the next largest value in nums strictly smaller than largest. Let its value be nextLargest.\nReduce nums[i] to nextLargest.\n\nReturn the number of operations to make all elements in nums equal.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [5,1,3]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:\xc2\xa0It takes 3 operations to make all elements in nums equal:\n1. largest = 5 at index 0. nextLargest = 3. Reduce nums[0] to 3. nums = [3,1,3].\n2. largest = 3 at index 0. nextLargest = 1. Reduce nums[0] to 1. nums = [1,1,3].\n3. largest = 3 at index 2. nextLargest = 1. Reduce nums[2] to 1. nums = [1,1,1].\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [1,1,1]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation:\xc2\xa0All elements in nums are already equal.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: nums = [1,1,2,2,3]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation:\xc2\xa0It takes 4 operations to make all elements in nums equal:\n1. largest = 3 at index 4. nextLargest = 2. Reduce nums[4] to 2. nums = [1,1,2,2,2].\n2. largest = 2 at index 2. nextLargest = 1. Reduce nums[2] to 1. nums = [1,1,1,2,2].\n3. largest = 2 at index 3. nextLargest = 1. Reduce nums[3] to 1. nums = [1,1,1,1,2].\n4. largest = 2 at index 4. nextLargest = 1. Reduce nums[4] to 1. nums = [1,1,1,1,1].\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104\n1 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 104\n\n'

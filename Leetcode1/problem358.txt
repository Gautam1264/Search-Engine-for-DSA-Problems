b'Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return the number of paths where the sum of the values\xc2\xa0along the path equals\xc2\xa0targetSum.\nThe path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (i.e., traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], targetSum = 8\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The paths that sum to 8 are shown.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], targetSum = 22\nOutput: 3\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 1000].\n-109 <= Node.val <= 109\n-1000 <= targetSum <= 1000\n\n'

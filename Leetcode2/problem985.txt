b'You are given a string s of length n containing only four kinds of characters: \'Q\', \'W\', \'E\', and \'R\'.\nA string is said to be balanced if each of its characters appears n / 4 times where n is the length of the string.\nReturn the minimum length of the substring that can be replaced with any other string of the same length to make s balanced. If s is already balanced, return 0.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "QWER"\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: s is already balanced.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "QQWE"\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: We need to replace a \'Q\' to \'R\', so that "RQWE" (or "QRWE") is balanced.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s = "QQQW"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: We can replace the first "QQ" to "ER". \n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nn == s.length\n4 <= n <= 105\nn is a multiple of 4.\ns contains only \'Q\', \'W\', \'E\', and \'R\'.\n\n'

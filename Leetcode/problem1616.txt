b'Given an integer array nums, find the maximum possible bitwise OR of a subset of nums and return the number of different non-empty subsets with the maximum bitwise OR.\nAn array a is a subset of an array b if a can be obtained from b by deleting some (possibly zero) elements of b. Two subsets are considered different if the indices of the elements chosen are different.\nThe bitwise OR of an array a is equal to a[0] OR a[1] OR ... OR a[a.length - 1] (0-indexed).\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [3,1]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The maximum possible bitwise OR of a subset is 3. There are 2 subsets with a bitwise OR of 3:\n- [3]\n- [3,1]\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [2,2,2]\nOutput: 7\nExplanation: All non-empty subsets of [2,2,2] have a bitwise OR of 2. There are 23 - 1 = 7 total subsets.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: nums = [3,2,1,5]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The maximum possible bitwise OR of a subset is 7. There are 6 subsets with a bitwise OR of 7:\n- [3,5]\n- [3,1,5]\n- [3,2,5]\n- [3,2,1,5]\n- [2,5]\n- [2,1,5]\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 16\n1 <= nums[i] <= 105\n\n'

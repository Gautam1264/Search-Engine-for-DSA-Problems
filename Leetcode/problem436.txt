b'Let\'s play the minesweeper game (Wikipedia, online game)!\nYou are given an m x n char matrix board representing the game board where:\n\n\'M\' represents an unrevealed mine,\n\'E\' represents an unrevealed empty square,\n\'B\' represents a revealed blank square that has no adjacent mines (i.e., above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals),\ndigit (\'1\' to \'8\') represents how many mines are adjacent to this revealed square, and\n\'X\' represents a revealed mine.\n\nYou are also given an integer array click where click = [clickr, clickc] represents the next click position among all the unrevealed squares (\'M\' or \'E\').\nReturn the board after revealing this position according to the following rules:\n\nIf a mine \'M\' is revealed, then the game is over. You should change it to \'X\'.\nIf an empty square \'E\' with no adjacent mines is revealed, then change it to a revealed blank \'B\' and all of its adjacent unrevealed squares should be revealed recursively.\nIf an empty square \'E\' with at least one adjacent mine is revealed, then change it to a digit (\'1\' to \'8\') representing the number of adjacent mines.\nReturn the board when no more squares will be revealed.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: board = [["E","E","E","E","E"],["E","E","M","E","E"],["E","E","E","E","E"],["E","E","E","E","E"]], click = [3,0]\nOutput: [["B","1","E","1","B"],["B","1","M","1","B"],["B","1","1","1","B"],["B","B","B","B","B"]]\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: board = [["B","1","E","1","B"],["B","1","M","1","B"],["B","1","1","1","B"],["B","B","B","B","B"]], click = [1,2]\nOutput: [["B","1","E","1","B"],["B","1","X","1","B"],["B","1","1","1","B"],["B","B","B","B","B"]]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nm == board.length\nn == board[i].length\n1 <= m, n <= 50\nboard[i][j] is either \'M\', \'E\', \'B\', or a digit from \'1\' to \'8\'.\nclick.length == 2\n0 <= clickr < m\n0 <= clickc < n\nboard[clickr][clickc] is either \'M\' or \'E\'.\n\n'

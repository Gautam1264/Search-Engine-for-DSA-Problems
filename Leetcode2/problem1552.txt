b'Given a string s and an array of strings words, determine whether s is a prefix string of words.\nA string s is a prefix string of words if s can be made by concatenating the first k strings in words for some positive k no larger than words.length.\nReturn true if s is a prefix string of words, or false otherwise.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "iloveleetcode", words = ["i","love","leetcode","apples"]\nOutput: true\nExplanation:\ns can be made by concatenating "i", "love", and "leetcode" together.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "iloveleetcode", words = ["apples","i","love","leetcode"]\nOutput: false\nExplanation:\nIt is impossible to make s using a prefix of arr.\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= words.length <= 100\n1 <= words[i].length <= 20\n1 <= s.length <= 1000\nwords[i] and s consist of only lowercase English letters.\n\n'

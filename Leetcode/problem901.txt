b'Given an n x n binary matrix grid, return the length of the shortest clear path in the matrix. If there is no clear path, return -1.\nA clear path in a binary matrix is a path from the top-left cell (i.e., (0, 0)) to the bottom-right cell (i.e., (n - 1, n - 1)) such that:\n\nAll the visited cells of the path are 0.\nAll the adjacent cells of the path are 8-directionally connected (i.e., they are different and they share an edge or a corner).\n\nThe length of a clear path is the number of visited cells of this path.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]\nOutput: 2\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: grid = [[0,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]]\nOutput: 4\n\nExample 3:\nInput: grid = [[1,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]]\nOutput: -1\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nn == grid.length\nn == grid[i].length\n1 <= n <= 100\ngrid[i][j] is 0 or 1\n\n'

b'Given two strings a and b, return the minimum number of times you should repeat string a so that string b is a substring of it. If it is impossible for b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b to be a substring of a after repeating it, return -1.\nNotice: string "abc" repeated 0 times is "", repeated 1 time is "abc" and repeated 2 times is "abcabc".\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: a = "abcd", b = "cdabcdab"\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: We return 3 because by repeating a three times "abcdabcdabcd", b is a substring of it.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: a = "a", b = "aa"\nOutput: 2\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= a.length, b.length <= 104\na and b consist of lowercase English letters.\n\n'

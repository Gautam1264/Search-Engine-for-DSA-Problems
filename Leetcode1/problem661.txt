b'There are n persons on a social media website. You are given an integer array ages where ages[i] is the age of the ith person.\nA Person x will not send a friend request to a person y (x != y) if any of the following conditions is true:\n\nage[y] <= 0.5 * age[x] + 7\nage[y] > age[x]\nage[y] > 100 && age[x] < 100\n\nOtherwise, x will send a friend request to y.\nNote that if x sends a request to y, y will not necessarily send a request to x. Also, a person will not send a friend request to themself.\nReturn the total number of friend requests made.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: ages = [16,16]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: 2 people friend request each other.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: ages = [16,17,18]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Friend requests are made 17 -> 16, 18 -> 17.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: ages = [20,30,100,110,120]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Friend requests are made 110 -> 100, 120 -> 110, 120 -> 100.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nn == ages.length\n1 <= n <= 2 * 104\n1 <= ages[i] <= 120\n\n'

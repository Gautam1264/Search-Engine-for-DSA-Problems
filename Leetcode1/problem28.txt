b'Implement strStr().\nGiven two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.\nClarification:\nWhat should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.\nFor the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C\'s strstr() and Java\'s indexOf().\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"\nOutput: 2\n\nExample 2:\nInput: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"\nOutput: -1\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104\nhaystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.\n\n'

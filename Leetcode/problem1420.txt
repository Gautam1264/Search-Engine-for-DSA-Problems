b'There is an undirected star graph consisting of n nodes labeled from 1 to n. A star graph is a graph where there is one center node and exactly n - 1 edges that connect the center node with every other node.\nYou are given a 2D integer array edges where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is an edge between the nodes ui and vi. Return the center of the given star graph.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[4,2]]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: As shown in the figure above, node 2 is connected to every other node, so 2 is the center.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: edges = [[1,2],[5,1],[1,3],[1,4]]\nOutput: 1\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n3 <= n <= 105\nedges.length == n - 1\nedges[i].length == 2\n1 <= ui, vi <= n\nui != vi\nThe given edges represent a valid star graph.\n\n'

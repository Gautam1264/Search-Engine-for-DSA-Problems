b'A transaction is possibly invalid if:\n\nthe amount exceeds $1000, or;\nif it occurs within (and including) 60 minutes of another transaction with the same name in a different city.\n\nYou are given an array of strings transaction where transactions[i] consists of comma-separated values representing the name, time (in minutes), amount, and city of the transaction.\nReturn a list of transactions that are possibly invalid.

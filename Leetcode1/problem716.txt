b'You are given an encoded string s. To decode the string to a tape, the encoded string is read one character at a time and the following steps are taken:\n\nIf the character read is a letter, that letter is written onto the tape.\nIf the character read is a digit d, the entire current tape is repeatedly written d - 1 more times in total.\n\nGiven an integer k, return the kth letter (1-indexed) in the decoded string.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "leet2code3", k = 10\nOutput: "o"\nExplanation: The decoded string is "leetleetcodeleetleetcodeleetleetcode".\nThe 10th letter in the string is "o".\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "ha22", k = 5\nOutput: "h"\nExplanation: The decoded string is "hahahaha".\nThe 5th letter is "h".\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s = "a2345678999999999999999", k = 1\nOutput: "a"\nExplanation: The decoded string is "a" repeated 8301530446056247680 times.\nThe 1st letter is "a".\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= s.length <= 100\ns consists of lowercase English letters and digits 2 through 9.\ns starts with a letter.\n1 <= k <= 109\nIt is guaranteed that k is less than or equal to the length of the decoded string.\nThe decoded string is guaranteed to have less than 263 letters.\n\n'

b'Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.\nAccording to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: \xe2\x80\x9cThe lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2\nOutput: 1\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].\n-109 <= Node.val <= 109\nAll Node.val are unique.\np != q\np and q will exist in the tree.\n\n'

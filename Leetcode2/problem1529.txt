b'Given a string s, return the number of unique palindromes of length three that are a subsequence of s.\nNote that even if there are multiple ways to obtain the same subsequence, it is still only counted once.\nA palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.\nA subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.\n\nFor example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "aabca"\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The 3 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:\n- "aba" (subsequence of "aabca")\n- "aaa" (subsequence of "aabca")\n- "aca" (subsequence of "aabca")\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "adc"\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: There are no palindromic subsequences of length 3 in "adc".\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s = "bbcbaba"\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: The 4 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:\n- "bbb" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")\n- "bcb" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")\n- "bab" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")\n- "aba" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n3 <= s.length <= 105\ns consists of only lowercase English letters.\n\n'

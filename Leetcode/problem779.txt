b'Given an array of strings words, return the smallest string that contains each string in words as a substring. If there are multiple valid strings of the smallest length, return any of them.\nYou may assume that no string in words is a substring of another string in words.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: words = ["alex","loves","leetcode"]\nOutput: "alexlovesleetcode"\nExplanation: All permutations of "alex","loves","leetcode" would also be accepted.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: words = ["catg","ctaagt","gcta","ttca","atgcatc"]\nOutput: "gctaagttcatgcatc"\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= words.length <= 12\n1 <= words[i].length <= 20\nwords[i] consists of lowercase English letters.\nAll the strings of words are unique.\n\n'

b'Given an array of strings patterns and a string word, return the number of strings in patterns that exist as a substring in word.\nA substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: patterns = ["a","abc","bc","d"], word = "abc"\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:\n- "a" appears as a substring in "abc".\n- "abc" appears as a substring in "abc".\n- "bc" appears as a substring in "abc".\n- "d" does not appear as a substring in "abc".\n3 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: patterns = ["a","b","c"], word = "aaaaabbbbb"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation:\n- "a" appears as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".\n- "b" appears as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".\n- "c" does not appear as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".\n2 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: patterns = ["a","a","a"], word = "ab"\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Each of the patterns appears as a substring in word "ab".\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= patterns.length <= 100\n1 <= patterns[i].length <= 100\n1 <= word.length <= 100\npatterns[i] and word consist of lowercase English letters.\n\n'

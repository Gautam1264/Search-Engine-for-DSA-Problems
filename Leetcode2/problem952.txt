b'You are given a string s and array queries where queries[i] = [lefti, righti, ki]. We may rearrange the substring s[lefti...righti] for each query and then choose up to ki of them to replace with any lowercase English letter.\nIf the substring is possible to be a palindrome string after the operations above, the result of the query is true. Otherwise, the result is false.\nReturn a boolean array answer where answer[i] is the result of the ith query queries[i].\nNote that each letter is counted individually for replacement, so if, for example s[lefti...righti] = "aaa", and ki = 2, we can only replace two of the letters. Also, note that no query modifies the initial string s.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample :\nInput: s = "abcda", queries = [[3,3,0],[1,2,0],[0,3,1],[0,3,2],[0,4,1]]\nOutput: [true,false,false,true,true]\nExplanation:\nqueries[0]: substring = "d", is palidrome.\nqueries[1]: substring = "bc", is not palidrome.\nqueries[2]: substring = "abcd", is not palidrome after replacing only 1 character.\nqueries[3]: substring = "abcd", could be changed to "abba" which is palidrome. Also this can be changed to "baab" first rearrange it "bacd" then replace "cd" with "ab".\nqueries[4]: substring = "abcda", could be changed to "abcba" which is palidrome.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "lyb", queries = [[0,1,0],[2,2,1]]\nOutput: [false,true]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length, queries.length <= 105\n0 <= lefti <= righti < s.length\n0 <= ki <= s.length\ns consists of lowercase English letters.\n\n'

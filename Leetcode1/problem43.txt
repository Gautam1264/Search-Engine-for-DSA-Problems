b'Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, return the product of num1 and num2, also represented as a string.\nNote:\xc2\xa0You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: num1 = "2", num2 = "3"\nOutput: "6"\nExample 2:\nInput: num1 = "123", num2 = "456"\nOutput: "56088"\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 200\nnum1 and num2 consist of digits only.\nBoth num1 and num2\xc2\xa0do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.\n\n'

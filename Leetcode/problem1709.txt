b'You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums consisting of 3 * n elements.\nYou are allowed to remove any subsequence of elements of size exactly n from nums. The remaining 2 * n elements will be divided into two equal parts:\n\nThe first n elements belonging to the first part and their sum is sumfirst.\nThe next n elements belonging to the second part and their sum is sumsecond.\n\nThe difference in sums of the two parts is denoted as sumfirst - sumsecond.\n\nFor example, if sumfirst = 3 and sumsecond = 2, their difference is 1.\nSimilarly, if sumfirst = 2 and sumsecond = 3, their difference is -1.\n\nReturn the minimum difference possible between the sums of the two parts after the removal of n elements.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [3,1,2]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: Here, nums has 3 elements, so n = 1. \nThus we have to remove 1 element from nums and divide the array into two equal parts.\n- If we remove nums[0] = 3, the array will be [1,2]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 1 - 2 = -1.\n- If we remove nums[1] = 1, the array will be [3,2]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 3 - 2 = 1.\n- If we remove nums[2] = 2, the array will be [3,1]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 3 - 1 = 2.\nThe minimum difference between sums of the two parts is min(-1,1,2) = -1. \n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [7,9,5,8,1,3]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: Here n = 2. So we must remove 2 elements and divide the remaining array into two parts containing two elements each.\nIf we remove nums[2] = 5 and nums[3] = 8, the resultant array will be [7,9,1,3]. The difference in sums will be (7+9) - (1+3) = 12.\nTo obtain the minimum difference, we should remove nums[1] = 9 and nums[4] = 1. The resultant array becomes [7,5,8,3]. The difference in sums of the two parts is (7+5) - (8+3) = 1.\nIt can be shown that it is not possible to obtain a difference smaller than 1.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nnums.length == 3 * n\n1 <= n <= 105\n1 <= nums[i] <= 105\n\n'

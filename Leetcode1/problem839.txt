b'Given a string s, determine if it is valid.\nA string s is valid if, starting with an empty string t = "", you can transform t into s after performing the following operation any number of times:\n\nInsert string "abc" into any position in t. More formally, t becomes tleft + "abc" + tright, where t == tleft + tright. Note that tleft and tright may be empty.\n\nReturn true if s is a valid string, otherwise, return false.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "aabcbc"\nOutput: true\nExplanation:\n"" -> "abc" -> "aabcbc"\nThus, "aabcbc" is valid.\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "abcabcababcc"\nOutput: true\nExplanation:\n"" -> "abc" -> "abcabc" -> "abcabcabc" -> "abcabcababcc"\nThus, "abcabcababcc" is valid.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s = "abccba"\nOutput: false\nExplanation: It is impossible to get "abccba" using the operation.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 2 * 104\ns consists of letters \'a\', \'b\', and \'c\'\n\n'

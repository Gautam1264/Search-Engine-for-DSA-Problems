b'You are given a string s. An awesome substring is a non-empty substring of s such that we can make any number of swaps in order to make it a palindrome.\nReturn the length of the maximum length awesome substring of s.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "3242415"\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: "24241" is the longest awesome substring, we can form the palindrome "24142" with some swaps.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "12345678"\nOutput: 1\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s = "213123"\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: "213123" is the longest awesome substring, we can form the palindrome "231132" with some swaps.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 105\ns consists only of digits.\n\n'

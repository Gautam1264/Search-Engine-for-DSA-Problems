b'Design a stack which supports the following operations.\nImplement the CustomStack class:\n\nCustomStack(int maxSize) Initializes the object with maxSize which is the maximum number of elements in the stack or do nothing if the stack reached the maxSize.\nvoid push(int x)\xc2\xa0Adds x to the top of the stack if the stack hasn\'t reached the maxSize.\nint pop()\xc2\xa0Pops and returns the top of stack or -1 if the stack is empty.\nvoid inc(int k, int val) Increments the bottom k elements of the stack by val. If there are less than k elements in the stack, just increment all the elements in the stack.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput\n["CustomStack","push","push","pop","push","push","push","increment","increment","pop","pop","pop","pop"]\n[[3],[1],[2],[],[2],[3],[4],[5,100],[2,100],[],[],[],[]]\nOutput\n[null,null,null,2,null,null,null,null,null,103,202,201,-1]\nExplanation\nCustomStack customStack = new CustomStack(3); // Stack is Empty []\ncustomStack.push(1);                          // stack becomes [1]\ncustomStack.push(2);                          // stack becomes [1, 2]\ncustomStack.pop();                            // return 2 --> Return top of the stack 2, stack becomes [1]\ncustomStack.push(2);                          // stack becomes [1, 2]\ncustomStack.push(3);                          // stack becomes [1, 2, 3]\ncustomStack.push(4);                          // stack still [1, 2, 3], Don\'t add another elements as size is 4\ncustomStack.increment(5, 100);                // stack becomes [101, 102, 103]\ncustomStack.increment(2, 100);                // stack becomes [201, 202, 103]\ncustomStack.pop();                            // return 103 --> Return top of the stack 103, stack becomes [201, 202]\ncustomStack.pop();                            // return 202 --> Return top of the stack 102, stack becomes [201]\ncustomStack.pop();                            // return 201 --> Return top of the stack 101, stack becomes []\ncustomStack.pop();                            // return -1 --> Stack is empty return -1.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= maxSize <= 1000\n1 <= x <= 1000\n1 <= k <= 1000\n0 <= val <= 100\nAt most\xc2\xa01000\xc2\xa0calls will be made to each method of increment, push and pop each separately.\n\n'

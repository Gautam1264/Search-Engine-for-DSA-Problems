b'You are given two strings s and t. In one step, you can append any character to either s or t.\nReturn the minimum number of steps to make s and t anagrams of each other.\nAn anagram of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "leetcode", t = "coats"\nOutput: 7\nExplanation: \n- In 2 steps, we can append the letters in "as" onto s = "leetcode", forming s = "leetcodeas".\n- In 5 steps, we can append the letters in "leede" onto t = "coats", forming t = "coatsleede".\n"leetcodeas" and "coatsleede" are now anagrams of each other.\nWe used a total of 2 + 5 = 7 steps.\nIt can be shown that there is no way to make them anagrams of each other with less than 7 steps.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "night", t = "thing"\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: The given strings are already anagrams of each other. Thus, we do not need any further steps.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length, t.length <= 2 * 105\ns and t consist of lowercase English letters.\n\n'

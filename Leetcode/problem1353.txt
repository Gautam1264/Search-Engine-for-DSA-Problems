b'There is a special kind of apple tree that grows apples every day for n days. On the ith day, the tree grows apples[i] apples that will rot after days[i] days, that is on day i + days[i] the apples will be rotten and cannot be eaten. On some days, the apple tree does not grow any apples, which are denoted by apples[i] == 0 and days[i] == 0.\nYou decided to eat at most one apple a day (to keep the doctors away). Note that you can keep eating after the first n days.\nGiven two integer arrays days and apples of length n, return the maximum number of apples you can eat.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: apples = [1,2,3,5,2], days = [3,2,1,4,2]\nOutput: 7\nExplanation: You can eat 7 apples:\n- On the first day, you eat an apple that grew on the first day.\n- On the second day, you eat an apple that grew on the second day.\n- On the third day, you eat an apple that grew on the second day. After this day, the apples that grew on the third day rot.\n- On the fourth to the seventh days, you eat apples that grew on the fourth day.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: apples = [3,0,0,0,0,2], days = [3,0,0,0,0,2]\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: You can eat 5 apples:\n- On the first to the third day you eat apples that grew on the first day.\n- Do nothing on the fouth and fifth days.\n- On the sixth and seventh days you eat apples that grew on the sixth day.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nn == apples.length == days.length\n1 <= n <= 2 * 104\n0 <= apples[i], days[i] <= 2 * 104\ndays[i] = 0 if and only if apples[i] = 0.\n\n'

b'You are given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n - 1. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by an array nums. You are asked to burst all the balloons.\nIf you burst the ith balloon, you will get nums[i - 1] * nums[i] * nums[i + 1] coins. If i - 1 or i + 1 goes out of bounds of the array, then treat it as if there is a balloon with a 1 painted on it.\nReturn the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [3,1,5,8]\nOutput: 167\nExplanation:\nnums = [3,1,5,8] --> [3,5,8] --> [3,8] --> [8] --> []\ncoins =  3*1*5    +   3*5*8   +  1*3*8  + 1*8*1 = 167\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [1,5]\nOutput: 10\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nn == nums.length\n1 <= n <= 300\n0 <= nums[i] <= 100\n\n'

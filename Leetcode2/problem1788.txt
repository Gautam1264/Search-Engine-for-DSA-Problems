b'You are given a string num representing a large integer. An integer is good if it meets the following conditions:\n\nIt is a substring of num with length 3.\nIt consists of only one unique digit.\n\nReturn the maximum good integer as a string or an empty string "" if no such integer exists.\nNote:\n\nA substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.\nThere may be leading zeroes in num or a good integer.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: num = "6777133339"\nOutput: "777"\nExplanation: There are two distinct good integers: "777" and "333".\n"777" is the largest, so we return "777".\n\nExample 2:\nInput: num = "2300019"\nOutput: "000"\nExplanation: "000" is the only good integer.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: num = "42352338"\nOutput: ""\nExplanation: No substring of length 3 consists of only one unique digit. Therefore, there are no good integers.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n3 <= num.length <= 1000\nnum only consists of digits.\n\n'

b'You have n gardens, labeled from 1 to n, and an array paths where paths[i] = [xi, yi] describes a bidirectional path between garden xi to garden yi. In each garden, you want to plant one of 4 types of flowers.\nAll gardens have at most 3 paths coming into or leaving it.\nYour task is to choose a flower type for each garden such that, for any two gardens connected by a path, they have different types of flowers.\nReturn any such a choice as an array answer, where answer[i] is the type of flower planted in the (i+1)th garden. The flower types are denoted 1, 2, 3, or 4. It is guaranteed an answer exists.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 3, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]\nOutput: [1,2,3]\nExplanation:\nGardens 1 and 2 have different types.\nGardens 2 and 3 have different types.\nGardens 3 and 1 have different types.\nHence, [1,2,3] is a valid answer. Other valid answers include [1,2,4], [1,4,2], and [3,2,1].\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 4, paths = [[1,2],[3,4]]\nOutput: [1,2,1,2]\n\nExample 3:\nInput: n = 4, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,1],[1,3],[2,4]]\nOutput: [1,2,3,4]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 104\n0 <= paths.length <= 2 * 104\npaths[i].length == 2\n1 <= xi, yi <= n\nxi != yi\nEvery garden has at most 3 paths coming into or leaving it.\n\n'

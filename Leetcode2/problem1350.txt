b'You are given a binary string binary consisting of only 0\'s or 1\'s. You can apply each of the following operations any number of times:\n\nOperation 1: If the number contains the substring "00", you can replace it with "10".\n\n\t\nFor example, "00010" -> "10010"\n\n\nOperation 2: If the number contains the substring "10", you can replace it with "01".\n\t\nFor example, "00010" -> "00001"\n\n\n\nReturn the maximum binary string you can obtain after any number of operations. Binary string x is greater than binary string y if x\'s decimal representation is greater than y\'s decimal representation.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: binary = "000110"\nOutput: "111011"\nExplanation: A valid transformation sequence can be:\n"000110" -> "000101" \n"000101" -> "100101" \n"100101" -> "110101" \n"110101" -> "110011" \n"110011" -> "111011"\n\nExample 2:\nInput: binary = "01"\nOutput: "01"\nExplanation:\xc2\xa0"01" cannot be transformed any further.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= binary.length <= 105\nbinary consist of \'0\' and \'1\'.\n\n'

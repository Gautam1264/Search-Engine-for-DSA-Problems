b'You are given an array of variable pairs equations and an array of real numbers values, where equations[i] = [Ai, Bi] and values[i] represent the equation Ai / Bi = values[i]. Each Ai or Bi is a string that represents a single variable.\nYou are also given some queries, where queries[j] = [Cj, Dj] represents the jth query where you must find the answer for Cj / Dj = ?.\nReturn the answers to all queries. If a single answer cannot be determined, return -1.0.\nNote: The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will not result in division by zero and that there is no contradiction.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"]], values = [2.0,3.0], queries = [["a","c"],["b","a"],["a","e"],["a","a"],["x","x"]]\nOutput: [6.00000,0.50000,-1.00000,1.00000,-1.00000]\nExplanation: \nGiven: a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0\nqueries are: a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ?\nreturn: [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ]\n\nExample 2:\nInput: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"],["bc","cd"]], values = [1.5,2.5,5.0], queries = [["a","c"],["c","b"],["bc","cd"],["cd","bc"]]\nOutput: [3.75000,0.40000,5.00000,0.20000]\n\nExample 3:\nInput: equations = [["a","b"]], values = [0.5], queries = [["a","b"],["b","a"],["a","c"],["x","y"]]\nOutput: [0.50000,2.00000,-1.00000,-1.00000]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= equations.length <= 20\nequations[i].length == 2\n1 <= Ai.length, Bi.length <= 5\nvalues.length == equations.length\n0.0 < values[i] <= 20.0\n1 <= queries.length <= 20\nqueries[i].length == 2\n1 <= Cj.length, Dj.length <= 5\nAi, Bi, Cj, Dj consist of lower case English letters and digits.\n\n'

b'You are given an integer num. Rearrange the digits of num such that its value is minimized and it does not contain any leading zeros.\nReturn the rearranged number with minimal value.\nNote that the sign of the number does not change after rearranging the digits.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: num = 310\nOutput: 103\nExplanation: The possible arrangements for the digits of 310 are 013, 031, 103, 130, 301, 310. \nThe arrangement with the smallest value that does not contain any leading zeros is 103.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: num = -7605\nOutput: -7650\nExplanation: Some possible arrangements for the digits of -7605 are -7650, -6705, -5076, -0567.\nThe arrangement with the smallest value that does not contain any leading zeros is -7650.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n-1015 <= num <= 1015\n\n'

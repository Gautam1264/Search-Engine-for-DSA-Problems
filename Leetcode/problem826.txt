b'You are given an array of strings equations that represent relationships between variables where each string equations[i] is of length 4 and takes one of two different forms: "xi==yi" or "xi!=yi".Here, xi and yi are lowercase letters (not necessarily different) that represent one-letter variable names.\nReturn true if it is possible to assign integers to variable names so as to satisfy all the given equations, or false otherwise.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: equations = ["a==b","b!=a"]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: If we assign say, a = 1 and b = 1, then the first equation is satisfied, but not the second.\nThere is no way to assign the variables to satisfy both equations.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: equations = ["b==a","a==b"]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: We could assign a = 1 and b = 1 to satisfy both equations.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= equations.length <= 500\nequations[i].length == 4\nequations[i][0] is a lowercase letter.\nequations[i][1] is either \'=\' or \'!\'.\nequations[i][2] is \'=\'.\nequations[i][3] is a lowercase letter.\n\n'

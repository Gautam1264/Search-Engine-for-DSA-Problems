b'You are given an array pairs, where pairs[i] = [xi, yi], and:\n\nThere are no duplicates.\nxi < yi\n\nLet ways be the number of rooted trees that satisfy the following conditions:\n\nThe tree consists of nodes whose values appeared in pairs.\nA pair [xi, yi] exists in pairs if and only if xi is an ancestor of yi or yi is an ancestor of xi.\nNote: the tree does not have to be a binary tree.\n\nTwo ways are considered to be different if there is at least one node that has different parents in both ways.\nReturn:\n\n0 if ways == 0\n1 if ways == 1\n2 if ways > 1\n\nA rooted tree is a tree that has a single root node, and all edges are oriented to be outgoing from the root.\nAn ancestor of a node is any node on the path from the root to that node (excluding the node itself). The root has no ancestors.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: pairs = [[1,2],[2,3]]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: There is exactly one valid rooted tree, which is shown in the above figure.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: pairs = [[1,2],[2,3],[1,3]]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: There are multiple valid rooted trees. Three of them are shown in the above figures.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: pairs = [[1,2],[2,3],[2,4],[1,5]]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: There are no valid rooted trees.\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= pairs.length <= 105\n1 <= xi < yi <= 500\nThe elements in pairs are unique.\n\n'

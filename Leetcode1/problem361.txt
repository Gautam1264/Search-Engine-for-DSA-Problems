b'You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.\nGiven the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 5\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 8\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 231 - 1\n\n'

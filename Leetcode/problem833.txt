b'In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.\nIf the town judge exists, then:\n\nThe town judge trusts nobody.\nEverybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.\nThere is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.\n\nYou are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi.\nReturn the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return -1 otherwise.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 2, trust = [[1,2]]\nOutput: 2\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]\nOutput: 3\n\nExample 3:\nInput: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]\nOutput: -1\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 1000\n0 <= trust.length <= 104\ntrust[i].length == 2\nAll the pairs of trust are unique.\nai != bi\n1 <= ai, bi <= n\n\n'

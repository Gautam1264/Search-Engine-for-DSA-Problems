b'You are given a binary array nums (0-indexed).\nWe define xi as the number whose binary representation is the subarray nums[0..i] (from most-significant-bit to least-significant-bit).\n\nFor example, if nums = [1,0,1], then x0 = 1, x1 = 2, and x2 = 5.\n\nReturn an array of booleans answer where answer[i] is true if xi is divisible by 5.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [0,1,1]\nOutput: [true,false,false]\nExplanation: The input numbers in binary are 0, 01, 011; which are 0, 1, and 3 in base-10.\nOnly the first number is divisible by 5, so answer[0] is true.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [1,1,1]\nOutput: [false,false,false]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 105\nnums[i] is either 0 or 1.\n\n'

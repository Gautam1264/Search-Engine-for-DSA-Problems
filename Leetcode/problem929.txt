b"Given a 2D grid of 0s and 1s, return the number of elements in\xc2\xa0the largest square\xc2\xa0subgrid that has all 1s on its border, or 0 if such a subgrid\xc2\xa0doesn't exist in the grid.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: grid = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]\nOutput: 9\n\nExample 2:\nInput: grid = [[1,1,0,0]]\nOutput: 1\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= grid.length <= 100\n1 <= grid[0].length <= 100\ngrid[i][j] is 0 or 1\n"

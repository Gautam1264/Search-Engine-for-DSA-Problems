b'There are n rooms you need to visit, labeled from 0 to n - 1. Each day is labeled, starting from 0. You will go in and visit one room a day.\nInitially on day 0, you visit room 0. The order you visit the rooms for the coming days is determined by the following rules and a given 0-indexed array nextVisit of length n:\n\nAssuming that on a day, you visit room i,\nif you have been in room i an odd number of times (including the current visit), on the next day you will visit a room with a lower or equal room number specified by nextVisit[i] where 0 <= nextVisit[i] <= i;\nif you have been in room i an even number of times (including the current visit), on the next day you will visit room (i + 1) mod n.\n\nReturn the label of the first day where you have been in all the rooms. It can be shown that such a day exists. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nextVisit = [0,0]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation:\n- On day 0, you visit room 0. The total times you have been in room 0 is 1, which is odd.\n\xc2\xa0 On the next day you will visit room nextVisit[0] = 0\n- On day 1, you visit room 0, The total times you have been in room 0 is 2, which is even.\n\xc2\xa0 On the next day you will visit room (0 + 1) mod 2 = 1\n- On day 2, you visit room 1. This is the first day where you have been in all the rooms.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nextVisit = [0,0,2]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation:\nYour room visiting order for each day is: [0,0,1,0,0,1,2,...].\nDay 6 is the first day where you have been in all the rooms.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: nextVisit = [0,1,2,0]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation:\nYour room visiting order for each day is: [0,0,1,1,2,2,3,...].\nDay 6 is the first day where you have been in all the rooms.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nn == nextVisit.length\n2 <= n <= 105\n0 <= nextVisit[i] <= i\n\n'

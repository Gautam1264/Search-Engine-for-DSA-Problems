b'You are given a 0-indexed string s and are tasked with finding two non-intersecting palindromic substrings of odd length such that the product of their lengths is maximized.\nMore formally, you want to choose four integers i, j, k, l such that 0 <= i <= j < k <= l < s.length and both the substrings s[i...j] and s[k...l] are palindromes and have odd lengths. s[i...j] denotes a substring from index i to index j inclusive.\nReturn the maximum possible product of the lengths of the two non-intersecting palindromic substrings.\nA palindrome is a string that is the same forward and backward. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "ababbb"\nOutput: 9\nExplanation: Substrings "aba" and "bbb" are palindromes with odd length. product = 3 * 3 = 9.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "zaaaxbbby"\nOutput: 9\nExplanation: Substrings "aaa" and "bbb" are palindromes with odd length. product = 3 * 3 = 9.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= s.length <= 105\ns consists of lowercase English letters.\n\n'

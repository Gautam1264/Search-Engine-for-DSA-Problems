b'We can use run-length encoding (i.e., RLE) to encode a sequence of integers. In a run-length encoded array of even length encoding (0-indexed), for all even i, encoding[i] tells us the number of times that the non-negative integer value encoding[i + 1] is repeated in the sequence.\n\nFor example, the sequence arr = [8,8,8,5,5] can be encoded to be encoding = [3,8,2,5]. encoding = [3,8,0,9,2,5] and encoding = [2,8,1,8,2,5] are also valid RLE of arr.\n\nGiven a run-length encoded array, design an iterator that iterates through it.\nImplement the RLEIterator class:\n\nRLEIterator(int[] encoded) Initializes the object with the encoded array encoded.\nint next(int n) Exhausts the next n elements and returns the last element exhausted in this way. If there is no element left to exhaust, return -1 instead.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput\n["RLEIterator", "next", "next", "next", "next"]\n[[[3, 8, 0, 9, 2, 5]], [2], [1], [1], [2]]\nOutput\n[null, 8, 8, 5, -1]\n\nExplanation\nRLEIterator rLEIterator = new RLEIterator([3, 8, 0, 9, 2, 5]); // This maps to the sequence [8,8,8,5,5].\nrLEIterator.next(2); // exhausts 2 terms of the sequence, returning 8. The remaining sequence is now [8, 5, 5].\nrLEIterator.next(1); // exhausts 1 term of the sequence, returning 8. The remaining sequence is now [5, 5].\nrLEIterator.next(1); // exhausts 1 term of the sequence, returning 5. The remaining sequence is now [5].\nrLEIterator.next(2); // exhausts 2 terms, returning -1. This is because the first term exhausted was 5,\nbut the second term did not exist. Since the last term exhausted does not exist, we return -1.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= encoding.length <= 1000\nencoding.length is even.\n0 <= encoding[i] <= 109\n1 <= n <= 109\nAt most 1000 calls will be made to next.\n\n'

b'We want to split a group of n people (labeled from 1 to n) into two groups of any size. Each person may dislike some other people, and they should not go into the same group.\nGiven the integer n and the array dislikes where dislikes[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that the person labeled ai does not like the person labeled bi, return true if it is possible to split everyone into two groups in this way.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 4, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,4]]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: group1 [1,4] and group2 [2,3].\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 3, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]\nOutput: false\n\nExample 3:\nInput: n = 5, dislikes = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5],[1,5]]\nOutput: false\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 2000\n0 <= dislikes.length <= 104\ndislikes[i].length == 2\n1 <= dislikes[i][j] <= n\nai < bi\nAll the pairs of dislikes are unique.\n\n'

b'You are given two strings s and t of the same length and an integer maxCost.\nYou want to change s to t. Changing the ith character of s to ith character of t costs |s[i] - t[i]| (i.e., the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters).\nReturn the maximum length of a substring of s that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of t with a cost less than or equal to maxCost. If there is no substring from s that can be changed to its corresponding substring from t, return 0.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "abcd", t = "bcdf", maxCost = 3\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: "abc" of s can change to "bcd".\nThat costs 3, so the maximum length is 3.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "abcd", t = "cdef", maxCost = 3\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: Each character in s costs 2 to change to character in t,  so the maximum length is 1.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s = "abcd", t = "acde", maxCost = 0\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: You cannot make any change, so the maximum length is 1.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 105\nt.length == s.length\n0 <= maxCost <= 106\ns and t consist of only lowercase English letters.\n\n'

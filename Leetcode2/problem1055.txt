b'You are given a string s consisting only of letters \'a\' and \'b\'. In a single step you can remove one palindromic subsequence from s.\nReturn the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.\nA string is a subsequence of a given string if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order. Note that a subsequence does not necessarily need to be contiguous.\nA string is called palindrome if is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "ababa"\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: s is already a palindrome, so its entirety can be removed in a single step.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "abb"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: "abb" -> "bb" -> "". \nRemove palindromic subsequence "a" then "bb".\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s = "baabb"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: "baabb" -> "b" -> "". \nRemove palindromic subsequence "baab" then "b".\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 1000\ns[i] is either \'a\' or \'b\'.\n\n'

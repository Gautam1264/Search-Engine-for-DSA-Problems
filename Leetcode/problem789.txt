b'In an alien language, surprisingly, they also use English lowercase letters, but possibly in a different order. The order of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.\nGiven a sequence of words written in the alien language, and the order of the alphabet, return true if and only if the given words are sorted lexicographically in this alien language.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"\nOutput: true\nExplanation: As \'h\' comes before \'l\' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"\nOutput: false\nExplanation: As \'d\' comes after \'l\' in this language, then words[0] > words[1], hence the sequence is unsorted.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: words = ["apple","app"], order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"\nOutput: false\nExplanation: The first three characters "app" match, and the second string is shorter (in size.) According to lexicographical rules "apple" > "app", because \'l\' > \'\xe2\x88\x85\', where \'\xe2\x88\x85\' is defined as the blank character which is less than any other character (More info).\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= words.length <= 100\n1 <= words[i].length <= 20\norder.length == 26\nAll characters in words[i] and order are English lowercase letters.\n\n'

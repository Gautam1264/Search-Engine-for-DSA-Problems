b'Given two strings s and t, return true if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. \'#\' means a backspace character.\nNote that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c"\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Both s and t become "ac".\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = "ab##", t = "c#d#"\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Both s and t become "".\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s = "a#c", t = "b"\nOutput: false\nExplanation: s becomes "c" while t becomes "b".\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length, t.length <= 200\ns and t only contain lowercase letters and \'#\' characters.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nFollow up: Can you solve it in O(n) time and O(1) space?\n'

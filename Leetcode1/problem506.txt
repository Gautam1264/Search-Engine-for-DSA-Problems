b'Solve a given equation and return the value of \'x\' in the form of a string "x=#value". The equation contains only \'+\', \'-\' operation, the variable \'x\' and its coefficient. You should return "No solution" if there is no solution for the equation, or "Infinite solutions" if there are infinite solutions for the equation.\nIf there is exactly one solution for the equation, we ensure that the value of \'x\' is an integer.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: equation = "x+5-3+x=6+x-2"\nOutput: "x=2"\n\nExample 2:\nInput: equation = "x=x"\nOutput: "Infinite solutions"\n\nExample 3:\nInput: equation = "2x=x"\nOutput: "x=0"\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n3 <= equation.length <= 1000\nequation has exactly one \'=\'.\nequation consists of integers with an absolute value in the range [0, 100] without any leading zeros, and the variable \'x\'.\n\n'

b"An integer interval [a, b] (for integers a < b) is a set of all consecutive integers from a to b, including a and b.\nFind the minimum size of a set S such that for every integer interval A in intervals, the intersection of S with A has a size of at least two.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: intervals = [[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[3,5]]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Consider the set S = {2, 3, 4}.  For each interval, there are at least 2 elements from S in the interval.\nAlso, there isn't a smaller size set that fulfills the above condition.\nThus, we output the size of this set, which is 3.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[2,4],[4,5]]\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: An example of a minimum sized set is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= intervals.length <= 3000\nintervals[i].length == 2\n0 <= ai <\xc2\xa0bi <= 108\n\n"

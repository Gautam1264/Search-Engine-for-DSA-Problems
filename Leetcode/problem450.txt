b'An attendance record for a student can be represented as a string where each character signifies whether the student was absent, late, or present on that day. The record only contains the following three characters:\n\n\'A\': Absent.\n\'L\': Late.\n\'P\': Present.\n\nAny student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet both of the following criteria:\n\nThe student was absent (\'A\') for strictly fewer than 2 days total.\nThe student was never late (\'L\') for 3 or more consecutive days.\n\nGiven an integer n, return the number of possible attendance records of length n that make a student eligible for an attendance award. The answer may be very large, so return it modulo 109 + 7.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 2\nOutput: 8\nExplanation: There are 8 records with length 2 that are eligible for an award:\n"PP", "AP", "PA", "LP", "PL", "AL", "LA", "LL"\nOnly "AA" is not eligible because there are 2 absences (there need to be fewer than 2).\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 1\nOutput: 3\n\nExample 3:\nInput: n = 10101\nOutput: 183236316\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 105\n\n'

b'Given an equation, represented by words on the left side and the result on the right side.\nYou need to check if the equation is solvable under the following rules:\n\nEach character is decoded as one digit (0 - 9).\nEvery pair of different characters must map to different digits.\nEach words[i] and result are decoded as one number without leading zeros.\nSum of numbers on the left side (words) will equal to the number on the right side (result).\n\nReturn true if the equation is solvable, otherwise return false.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: words = ["SEND","MORE"], result = "MONEY"\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Map \'S\'-> 9, \'E\'->5, \'N\'->6, \'D\'->7, \'M\'->1, \'O\'->0, \'R\'->8, \'Y\'->\'2\'\nSuch that: "SEND" + "MORE" = "MONEY" ,  9567 + 1085 = 10652\nExample 2:\nInput: words = ["SIX","SEVEN","SEVEN"], result = "TWENTY"\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Map \'S\'-> 6, \'I\'->5, \'X\'->0, \'E\'->8, \'V\'->7, \'N\'->2, \'T\'->1, \'W\'->\'3\', \'Y\'->4\nSuch that: "SIX" + "SEVEN" + "SEVEN" = "TWENTY" ,  650 + 68782 + 68782 = 138214\nExample 3:\nInput: words = ["LEET","CODE"], result = "POINT"\nOutput: false\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= words.length <= 5\n1 <= words[i].length, result.length <= 7\nwords[i], result contain only uppercase English letters.\nThe number of different characters used in the expression is at most 10.\n\n'

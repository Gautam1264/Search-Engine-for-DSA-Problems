b'The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the 0\'s to 1\'s and all the 1\'s to 0\'s in its binary representation.\n\nFor example, The integer 5 is "101" in binary and its complement is "010" which is the integer 2.\n\nGiven an integer n, return its complement.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 5\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: 5 is "101" in binary, with complement "010" in binary, which is 2 in base-10.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 7\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: 7 is "111" in binary, with complement "000" in binary, which is 0 in base-10.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: n = 10\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: 10 is "1010" in binary, with complement "0101" in binary, which is 5 in base-10.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n0 <= n < 109\n\n\xc2\xa0\nNote: This question is the same as 476: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/\n'

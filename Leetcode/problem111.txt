b'Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.\nThe minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.\nNote:\xc2\xa0A leaf is a node with no children.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]\nOutput: 2\n\nExample 2:\nInput: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]\nOutput: 5\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 105].\n-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000\n\n'

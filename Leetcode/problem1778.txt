b'You are given a 2D integer array rectangles where rectangles[i] = [li, hi] indicates that ith rectangle has a length of li and a height of hi. You are also given a 2D integer array points where points[j] = [xj, yj] is a point with coordinates (xj, yj).\nThe ith rectangle has its bottom-left corner point at the coordinates (0, 0) and its top-right corner point at (li, hi).\nReturn an integer array count of length points.length where count[j] is the number of rectangles that contain the jth point.\nThe ith rectangle contains the jth point if 0 <= xj <= li and 0 <= yj <= hi. Note that points that lie on the edges of a rectangle are also considered to be contained by that rectangle.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: rectangles = [[1,2],[2,3],[2,5]], points = [[2,1],[1,4]]\nOutput: [2,1]\nExplanation: \nThe first rectangle contains no points.\nThe second rectangle contains only the point (2, 1).\nThe third rectangle contains the points (2, 1) and (1, 4).\nThe number of rectangles that contain the point (2, 1) is 2.\nThe number of rectangles that contain the point (1, 4) is 1.\nTherefore, we return [2, 1].\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: rectangles = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]], points = [[1,3],[1,1]]\nOutput: [1,3]\nExplanation:\nThe first rectangle contains only the point (1, 1).\nThe second rectangle contains only the point (1, 1).\nThe third rectangle contains the points (1, 3) and (1, 1).\nThe number of rectangles that contain the point (1, 3) is 1.\nThe number of rectangles that contain the point (1, 1) is 3.\nTherefore, we return [1, 3].\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= rectangles.length, points.length <= 5 * 104\nrectangles[i].length == points[j].length == 2\n1 <= li, xj <= 109\n1 <= hi, yj <= 100\nAll the rectangles are unique.\nAll the points are unique.\n\n'

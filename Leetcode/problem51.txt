b'The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.\nGiven an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. You may return the answer in any order.\nEach solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens\' placement, where \'Q\' and \'.\' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 4\nOutput: [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]]\nExplanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 1\nOutput: [["Q"]]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 9\n\n'

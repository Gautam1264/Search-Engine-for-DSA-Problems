b'Given the root of a complete binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.\nAccording to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.\nDesign an algorithm that runs in less than\xc2\xa0O(n)\xc2\xa0time complexity.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]\nOutput: 6\n\nExample 2:\nInput: root = []\nOutput: 0\n\nExample 3:\nInput: root = [1]\nOutput: 1\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5 * 104].\n0 <= Node.val <= 5 * 104\nThe tree is guaranteed to be complete.\n\n'

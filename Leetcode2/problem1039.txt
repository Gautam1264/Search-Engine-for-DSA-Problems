b'We are given a list nums of integers representing a list compressed with run-length encoding.\nConsider each adjacent pair\xc2\xa0of elements [freq, val] = [nums[2*i], nums[2*i+1]]\xc2\xa0(with i >= 0).\xc2\xa0 For each such pair, there are freq elements with value val concatenated in a sublist. Concatenate all the sublists from left to right to generate the decompressed list.\nReturn the decompressed list.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4]\nOutput: [2,4,4,4]\nExplanation: The first pair [1,2] means we have freq = 1 and val = 2 so we generate the array [2].\nThe second pair [3,4] means we have freq = 3 and val = 4 so we generate [4,4,4].\nAt the end the concatenation [2] + [4,4,4] is [2,4,4,4].\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [1,1,2,3]\nOutput: [1,3,3]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= nums.length <= 100\nnums.length % 2 == 0\n1 <= nums[i] <= 100\n\n'

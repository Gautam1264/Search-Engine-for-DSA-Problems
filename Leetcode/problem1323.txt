b'For a string sequence, a string word is k-repeating if word concatenated k times is a substring of sequence. The word\'s maximum k-repeating value is the highest value k where word is k-repeating in sequence. If word is not a substring of sequence, word\'s maximum k-repeating value is 0.\nGiven strings sequence and word, return the maximum k-repeating value of word in sequence.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: sequence = "ababc", word = "ab"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: "abab" is a substring in "ababc".\n\nExample 2:\nInput: sequence = "ababc", word = "ba"\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: "ba" is a substring in "ababc". "baba" is not a substring in "ababc".\n\nExample 3:\nInput: sequence = "ababc", word = "ac"\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: "ac" is not a substring in "ababc". \n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= sequence.length <= 100\n1 <= word.length <= 100\nsequence and word\xc2\xa0contains only lowercase English letters.\n\n'

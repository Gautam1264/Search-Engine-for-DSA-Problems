b'You are given an array nums of n positive integers.\nYou can perform two types of operations on any element of the array any number of times:\n\nIf the element is even, divide it by 2.\n\n\t\nFor example, if the array is [1,2,3,4], then you can do this operation on the last element, and the array will be [1,2,3,2].\n\n\nIf the element is odd, multiply it by 2.\n\t\nFor example, if the array is [1,2,3,4], then you can do this operation on the first element, and the array will be [2,2,3,4].\n\n\n\nThe deviation of the array is the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.\nReturn the minimum deviation the array can have after performing some number of operations.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: You can transform the array to [1,2,3,2], then to [2,2,3,2], then the deviation will be 3 - 2 = 1.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [4,1,5,20,3]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: You can transform the array after two operations to [4,2,5,5,3], then the deviation will be 5 - 2 = 3.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: nums = [2,10,8]\nOutput: 3\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nn == nums.length\n2 <= n <= 5 * 104\n1 <= nums[i] <= 109\n\n'

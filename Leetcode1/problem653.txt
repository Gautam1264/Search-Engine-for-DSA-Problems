b'You are given the head of a linked list containing unique integer values and an integer array nums that is a subset of the linked list values.\nReturn the number of connected components in nums where two values are connected if they appear consecutively in the linked list.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: head = [0,1,2,3], nums = [0,1,3]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: 0 and 1 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3] are the two connected components.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: head = [0,1,2,3,4], nums = [0,3,1,4]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: 0 and 1 are connected, 3 and 4 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3, 4] are the two connected components.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the linked list is n.\n1 <= n <= 104\n0 <= Node.val < n\nAll the values Node.val are unique.\n1 <= nums.length <= n\n0 <= nums[i] < n\nAll the values of nums are unique.\n\n'

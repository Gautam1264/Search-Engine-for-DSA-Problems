b'The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.\nGiven two integers x and y, return the Hamming distance between them.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: x = 1, y = 4\nOutput: 2\nExplanation:\n1   (0 0 0 1)\n4   (0 1 0 0)\n       \xe2\x86\x91   \xe2\x86\x91\nThe above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: x = 3, y = 1\nOutput: 1\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n0 <=\xc2\xa0x, y <= 231 - 1\n\n'

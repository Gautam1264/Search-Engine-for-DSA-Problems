b'You are given a m x n matrix grid. Initially, you are located at the top-left corner (0, 0), and in each step, you can only move right or down in the matrix.\nAmong all possible paths starting from the top-left corner (0, 0) and ending in the bottom-right corner (m - 1, n - 1), find the path with the maximum non-negative product. The product of a path is the product of all integers in the grid cells visited along the path.\nReturn the maximum non-negative product modulo 109 + 7. If the maximum product is negative, return -1.\nNotice that the modulo is performed after getting the maximum product.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: grid = [[-1,-2,-3],[-2,-3,-3],[-3,-3,-2]]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: It is not possible to get non-negative product in the path from (0, 0) to (2, 2), so return -1.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: grid = [[1,-2,1],[1,-2,1],[3,-4,1]]\nOutput: 8\nExplanation: Maximum non-negative product is shown (1 * 1 * -2 * -4 * 1 = 8).\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: grid = [[1,3],[0,-4]]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: Maximum non-negative product is shown (1 * 0 * -4 = 0).\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nm == grid.length\nn == grid[i].length\n1 <= m, n <= 15\n-4 <= grid[i][j] <= 4\n\n'

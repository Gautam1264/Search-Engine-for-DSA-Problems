b'Given the root of a binary tree, the value of a target node target, and an integer k, return an array of the values of all nodes that have a distance k from the target node.\nYou can return the answer in any order.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], target = 5, k = 2\nOutput: [7,4,1]\nExplanation: The nodes that are a distance 2 from the target node (with value 5) have values 7, 4, and 1.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: root = [1], target = 1, k = 3\nOutput: []\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 500].\n0 <= Node.val <= 500\nAll the values Node.val are unique.\ntarget is the value of one of the nodes in the tree.\n0 <= k <= 1000\n\n'

b'Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3\nOutput: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]\nExplanation:\nrotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]\nrotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]\nrotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2\nOutput: [3,99,-1,-100]\nExplanation: \nrotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]\nrotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 105\n-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1\n0 <= k <= 105\n\n\xc2\xa0\nFollow up:\n\nTry to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least three different ways to solve this problem.\nCould you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?\n\n'

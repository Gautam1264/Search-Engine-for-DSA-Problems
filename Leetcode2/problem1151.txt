b'Given an integer n, return a list of all simplified fractions between 0 and 1 (exclusive) such that the denominator is less-than-or-equal-to n. You can return the answer in any order.\n\xc2\xa0\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 2\nOutput: ["1/2"]\nExplanation: "1/2" is the only unique fraction with a denominator less-than-or-equal-to 2.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 3\nOutput: ["1/2","1/3","2/3"]\n\nExample 3:\nInput: n = 4\nOutput: ["1/2","1/3","1/4","2/3","3/4"]\nExplanation: "2/4" is not a simplified fraction because it can be simplified to "1/2".\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 100\n\n'
